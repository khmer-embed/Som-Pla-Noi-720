00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.875
Som Pla Noi

00:00:53.583 --> 00:00:54.875
Greetings, sir.

00:00:59.208 --> 00:01:00.041
Chief Tik.

00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:03.375
Is our local team in good form?
Ready to give a good kicking?

00:01:03.708 --> 00:01:05.000
They're okay.

00:01:05.541 --> 00:01:07.083
But they enjoy kicking monks more.

00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:11.416
Run, sir, run.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.958
Leap like a tiger.

00:01:13.041 --> 00:01:15.000
No kicking around here I hope.

00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:21.416
-C'mon, bring the rice.
-Yes, Mom.

00:01:22.708 --> 00:01:23.958
The monks are coming.

00:01:26.291 --> 00:01:27.708
Hurry up.

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:29.666
I was feeding the fish.

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:34.333
Greetings, Venerable Chai.

00:01:34.416 --> 00:01:36.625
Bua. When did you arrive?

00:01:36.708 --> 00:01:39.291
A couple of days ago, sir.
I'm visiting my children.

00:01:39.375 --> 00:01:40.541
I see.

00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:41.458
Noi.

00:01:41.541 --> 00:01:42.916
I haven't seen you two days

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.250
and you've already grown a hipster beard.

00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:47.208
Goldfish memory…

00:01:47.291 --> 00:01:49.041
I'm not Noi, I'm Sian.

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:51.041
Noi is over there.

00:01:51.125 --> 00:01:52.041
Noi! Noi!

00:01:55.833 --> 00:01:56.666
Noi! Noi!

00:01:58.833 --> 00:01:59.875
Your pal's here.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.750
Not pal! It's Monk Chai.

00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:05.791
I was kidding.

00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:07.458
Oh, Phak. You're here too.

00:02:07.541 --> 00:02:08.458
Sir.

00:02:08.541 --> 00:02:10.583
Do you have children now?

00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:12.791
Not yet, sir. He keeps firing blanks.

00:02:14.583 --> 00:02:17.541
Phak, you should
grease his joystick sometimes.

00:02:18.083 --> 00:02:21.750
Sian has the meat,
but he doesn't have the juice.

00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:22.958
What a waste.

00:02:23.875 --> 00:02:27.708
So you're good at greasing joysticks?

00:02:28.791 --> 00:02:30.041
I'm the best, sir.

00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:31.416
No need to stress.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.333
The best, sure.

00:02:33.583 --> 00:02:34.958
Greetings, sir.

00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:36.041
So…

00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:37.958
What are you doing?

00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:40.041
-Watering the plants, sir.
-Right.

00:02:40.541 --> 00:02:44.625
Sir, I intended to donate some cash today,

00:02:44.708 --> 00:02:47.291
but I left my purse in the house.

00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:48.291
Tomorrow then.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.875
Don't worry.

00:02:53.416 --> 00:02:55.041
A <i>QR code…</i>

00:02:55.541 --> 00:02:56.458
Yep.

00:02:56.541 --> 00:02:57.708
We're in a cashless society.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.333
Don't smoke now!

00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:07.750
He'll smell it.

00:03:08.458 --> 00:03:09.583
I've warned you often

00:03:09.666 --> 00:03:11.083
to cut back on weed.

00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:13.666
Scanning now.

00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:18.666
My first donation in months.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.375
I put in 2,000 baht.

00:03:20.875 --> 00:03:22.041
Done?

00:03:22.875 --> 00:03:23.833
Well…

00:03:24.708 --> 00:03:26.000
If you've done it,

00:03:26.916 --> 00:03:28.083
we'll carry on.

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:30.833
Blessings, sir.

00:03:38.458 --> 00:03:39.458
Look, Mom.

00:03:39.541 --> 00:03:41.208
Venerable, sir!

00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:43.666
You forgot my food offerings.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.916
You got 2,000 baht and then you ran off!

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.416
I won't take it back, don't worry.

00:04:07.875 --> 00:04:09.708
In a good mood?

00:04:24.541 --> 00:04:26.166
This is dope!

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.333
Isn't it too early?

00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:29.583
Just a sip.

00:04:30.166 --> 00:04:32.375
-Go give alms to the monks.
-Yes, babe.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.166
Som, ready?

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.083
Yes.

00:04:36.166 --> 00:04:38.750
You're open already?

00:04:38.833 --> 00:04:39.750
Yes, sir.

00:04:41.416 --> 00:04:42.250
Good business?

00:04:42.333 --> 00:04:44.333
We get by, sir.

00:04:45.208 --> 00:04:47.041
Someone stinks of booze.

00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:48.416
Me, sir.

00:04:48.708 --> 00:04:49.916
Care for a shot?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.833
Stop!

00:04:50.916 --> 00:04:52.208
That's blasphemy!

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.875
It's okay, I heard some monks even
do hard drugs.

00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.583
You're going to burn in hell.

00:04:58.583 --> 00:05:01.041
Let's make the offerings.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.166
May you be blessed with
long lives and good health.

00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.250
<i>Should I pity you, girl?</i>

00:05:14.333 --> 00:05:16.291
<i>Should I pity you, girl?</i>

00:05:16.375 --> 00:05:18.750
<i>The moon girl carries</i>
<i>The weight of the world…</i>

00:05:19.666 --> 00:05:21.541
You like Pornsak's songs?

00:05:22.125 --> 00:05:24.208
Not really.

00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:25.666
He sounds like a howling dog.

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:34.333
-Yellow bird?
-Myna.

00:05:34.416 --> 00:05:35.541
-Dumb bird?
-Stork.

00:05:35.625 --> 00:05:37.208
-Foulmouthed bird?
-Parrot.

00:05:37.291 --> 00:05:38.500
-Dirty bird?
-Pigeon.

00:05:38.583 --> 00:05:40.333
-Horny bird?
-Cockatoo.

00:05:43.333 --> 00:05:45.500
-Monk Ek, Monk Rong, Monk Lor.
-Sir.

00:05:45.583 --> 00:05:47.291
File this.

00:05:47.375 --> 00:05:48.500
This goes in the safe box.

00:05:48.583 --> 00:05:49.833
Xerox this.

00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:51.458
Remove the staples first.

00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.125
Sir, there are no more staples.

00:05:56.666 --> 00:05:57.500
No?

00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.416
Why didn't Sinn inform me?

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.416
Sinn!

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.458
Sir.

00:06:02.041 --> 00:06:03.791
-Go buy some Max.
-Yes, sir.

00:06:05.208 --> 00:06:06.083
And the money?

00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:07.083
Advance it.

00:06:07.166 --> 00:06:08.041
Again?

00:06:08.125 --> 00:06:08.958
Yes.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:10.708
Damn.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.750
Will he ever pay me back?

00:06:12.833 --> 00:06:14.041
Advance again.

00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:16.666
What a sourpuss.

00:06:18.541 --> 00:06:19.708
-Horny bird?
-Cockatoo.

00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:20.708
-Funny bird?
-Kiwi.

00:06:20.791 --> 00:06:22.500
-Who eats shit?
-I do!

00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.208
Well, are we monks or clowns?

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.750
Watch where you're going!

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.666
So it was my fault?

00:06:46.458 --> 00:06:48.375
Of course! You almost crashed into me!

00:06:49.458 --> 00:06:51.333
You were speeding.

00:06:51.666 --> 00:06:52.666
We can check the camera.

00:06:54.708 --> 00:06:55.875
Still think it's my fault?

00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:58.958
Okay, my bad.

00:06:59.833 --> 00:07:00.666
Sorry.

00:07:08.791 --> 00:07:10.000
What are you staring at?

00:07:10.083 --> 00:07:11.250
Never seen a goddess?

00:07:22.083 --> 00:07:23.000
Wow…

00:07:24.083 --> 00:07:25.208
A goddess indeed.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:32.708 line:20%
This is McPork.

00:07:32.791 --> 00:07:34.041 line:20%
This is McBeef.

00:07:34.125 --> 00:07:35.333 line:20%
And the McChicken.

00:07:35.416 --> 00:07:36.833 line:20%
Are you high or stupid?

00:07:36.916 --> 00:07:37.833 line:20%
I said "Max".

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:38.750 line:20%
This!

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:40.000 line:20%
I meant this!

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.083
You screwed up the pronunciation.

00:07:44.708 --> 00:07:46.916
You said Mac.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.791
As in McDonald's.

00:07:49.333 --> 00:07:50.875 line:20%
Learn to say things clearly.

00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.791
I'm in a jam here, sir.

00:07:52.875 --> 00:07:54.166
What a mess.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:57.083
Dumbass. What an idiot.

00:08:09.333 --> 00:08:10.875
Hi, Auntie.

00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:11.791
Hi, Uncle.

00:08:11.875 --> 00:08:13.083
Hi there.

00:08:13.833 --> 00:08:14.958
Som, are you ready?

00:08:15.041 --> 00:08:16.250
Give me a sec.

00:08:16.333 --> 00:08:18.333
Where are you off to?

00:08:18.916 --> 00:08:20.875
We're going to get wasted tonight.

00:08:21.708 --> 00:08:22.875
Great, that's great.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.125
Enjoy it, son.

00:08:26.041 --> 00:08:27.583
Why're you egging them on?

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.250
They're not children anymore.

00:08:31.291 --> 00:08:34.041
Let them have fun.
It reminds me of the old days.

00:08:34.125 --> 00:08:36.458
Stop right there.

00:08:36.541 --> 00:08:38.208
Don't get drunk, okay?

00:08:38.291 --> 00:08:39.375
Sure.

00:08:39.458 --> 00:08:41.500
Don't try to bang me when you get drunk.

00:08:42.291 --> 00:08:44.458
You're selfish.

00:08:45.041 --> 00:08:46.875
I'm going with her, so bang me too.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.250
I'll pass. Gives me goose bumps.

00:08:50.333 --> 00:08:52.000
You don't know what you're missing.

00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:02.750
Cheers!

00:09:10.333 --> 00:09:13.125
Two glasses and you're out already?

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:15.333
Noi.

00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:17.125
Noi!

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.333
Are we leaving?

00:09:19.416 --> 00:09:20.500
I'll give you a ride.

00:09:21.125 --> 00:09:22.000
We just got here.

00:09:22.083 --> 00:09:23.333
We're not leaving, man.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.875
Do Ja-eh's voice.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.291
Now the prime minister's.

00:09:32.375 --> 00:09:34.583
We should hang out to promote the economy.

00:09:34.666 --> 00:09:35.666
If not us, who will?

00:09:36.791 --> 00:09:37.625
Now Sek's.

00:09:37.708 --> 00:09:40.416
Five minutes here
and I feel like I'm 14 again.

00:09:40.916 --> 00:09:41.875
The prime minister.

00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.541
If not us, who will?

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:44.541
Now Ja-eh's.

00:09:45.333 --> 00:09:46.166
Enough!

00:09:47.083 --> 00:09:47.916
Now Sarinee's.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.166
Sarinee? Who the hell is Sarinee?

00:09:53.625 --> 00:09:54.583
Cheers!

00:09:58.291 --> 00:10:00.875
Hey, why are we here?

00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.166
Plenty of bars in Bangkok

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:05.625
and you dragged me to this hillbilly dive?

00:10:06.083 --> 00:10:07.041
Don't be a killjoy.

00:10:07.416 --> 00:10:09.208
Look there.

00:10:09.541 --> 00:10:10.625
Enlighten me.

00:10:10.708 --> 00:10:12.041
Is that a blobfish or what?

00:10:13.541 --> 00:10:15.083
Man, she may not be your type.

00:10:15.166 --> 00:10:16.541
But she's an angel to someone.

00:10:16.625 --> 00:10:18.541
Some men have a unique taste, like me.

00:10:18.625 --> 00:10:20.916
This chick is unique and exotic.

00:10:22.708 --> 00:10:23.541
Just my type.

00:10:26.083 --> 00:10:26.916
Gotcha.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.416
Stop!

00:10:31.791 --> 00:10:32.666
Bird of paradise.

00:10:34.416 --> 00:10:36.250
Cut it out!

00:10:36.333 --> 00:10:37.708
Look at that rare bird.

00:10:41.791 --> 00:10:43.916
Told you there's something for everyone.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.125
I can stay all night.

00:10:46.541 --> 00:10:47.500
Cheers!

00:10:57.666 --> 00:10:58.500
Hey!

00:10:58.583 --> 00:11:00.250
Watch where you're going!

00:11:00.333 --> 00:11:01.416
Sorry.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.708
Is that enough?

00:11:02.791 --> 00:11:04.125
I should beat you up.

00:11:04.208 --> 00:11:05.041
Hey!

00:11:05.625 --> 00:11:06.833
What's going on here?

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:08.833
-Are you messing with my friend?
-No.

00:11:08.916 --> 00:11:10.083
I saw it!

00:11:10.166 --> 00:11:11.458
You stepped on my toes!

00:11:11.541 --> 00:11:13.000
My toes!

00:11:13.083 --> 00:11:14.166
Hey!

00:11:14.708 --> 00:11:15.833
What's going on?

00:11:16.666 --> 00:11:17.500
Wow.

00:11:18.083 --> 00:11:19.000
Bird of paradise.

00:11:19.708 --> 00:11:20.625
What bird?

00:11:20.708 --> 00:11:21.875
I'm Som.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.083
Som…

00:11:25.583 --> 00:11:27.416
Sweet or sour?

00:11:28.041 --> 00:11:29.291
Juicy? Can I have a taste?

00:11:30.416 --> 00:11:31.916
Leave some seeds for me.

00:11:34.208 --> 00:11:35.458
Are you two together?

00:11:38.833 --> 00:11:39.666
Looks familiar.

00:11:40.916 --> 00:11:41.875
Partner in crime.

00:11:43.666 --> 00:11:44.541
Let's go.

00:11:44.708 --> 00:11:45.541
Why?

00:11:45.625 --> 00:11:46.458
He's a criminal.

00:11:47.416 --> 00:11:48.708
She means he's a friend.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:51.916
It's good that way.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.291
What's your problem?

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:57.375
I mean if you're not together,
that's great.

00:11:59.583 --> 00:12:00.541
Let's go, Ja-eh.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.416
Come, Sarinee.

00:12:07.291 --> 00:12:09.666
Sure, I'm thirsty for whisky.

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:11.208
Let's continue.

00:12:12.541 --> 00:12:13.958
I'm getting properly drunk.

00:12:15.583 --> 00:12:17.833
They played all the jokes.

00:12:17.916 --> 00:12:19.416
Nothing left for me.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.375
Stupid clowns.

00:12:23.125 --> 00:12:25.291
If you're in trouble, let me know, okay?

00:12:48.625 --> 00:12:49.458
Noi.

00:12:49.708 --> 00:12:51.041
He's completely wasted.

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:54.666
Are you guys okay?

00:12:56.208 --> 00:12:57.375
Let me give you a lift.

00:13:14.291 --> 00:13:16.000
What are you smiling at?

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:18.250
Nothing.

00:13:18.375 --> 00:13:19.291
Well…

00:13:25.708 --> 00:13:27.541
Your stop.

00:13:39.458 --> 00:13:40.291
Wow.

00:13:40.375 --> 00:13:41.666
Pork porridge?

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:44.458
That's gross.

00:13:44.541 --> 00:13:45.875
These kids are unbelievable.

00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:46.791
Eat it up.

00:13:46.875 --> 00:13:48.208
Your porridge stinks!

00:13:48.708 --> 00:13:51.000
It'll give you the runs.

00:14:07.125 --> 00:14:10.833
BROKEN-HEARTED NUN

00:14:15.625 --> 00:14:17.791
A NUN BREAKS MY HEART

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.875
SMALL MONK, SMALL DICK

00:14:37.625 --> 00:14:38.916
Who's in there?

00:14:39.208 --> 00:14:40.041
A nun!

00:14:43.541 --> 00:14:44.750
Hurry up.

00:14:47.875 --> 00:14:51.916
<i>My good nun,</i>
<i>It took you so long to take a dump</i>

00:14:53.541 --> 00:14:57.291
<i>Push them out, those brown little clumps</i>

00:14:59.625 --> 00:15:02.458
<i>You're tormenting me, you little shit pump</i>

00:15:02.541 --> 00:15:05.458
<i>Have mercy, hurry up and drop your dump</i>

00:15:05.791 --> 00:15:08.375
<i>Push them out, make them jump</i>

00:15:08.666 --> 00:15:11.416
<i>My good nun,</i>
<i>Time to drop those little clumps</i>

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.333
Damn, don't rush me!

00:15:13.833 --> 00:15:14.916
It's stuck!

00:15:19.666 --> 00:15:20.708
Aargh!

00:15:27.291 --> 00:15:28.125
Dui.

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:29.083
Ma'am.

00:15:29.708 --> 00:15:31.291
Someone scribbled on the walls.

00:15:31.375 --> 00:15:32.666
Scrub it off.

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:33.583
Yes, ma'am.

00:16:00.666 --> 00:16:01.500
Guys.

00:16:02.333 --> 00:16:03.708
Check out those chicks.

00:16:03.791 --> 00:16:04.625
Where?

00:16:11.083 --> 00:16:11.958
Hot damn.

00:16:14.416 --> 00:16:17.041
Don't pound that mortar too hard.

00:16:17.125 --> 00:16:18.083
What should she do?

00:16:18.166 --> 00:16:19.375
Pound my heart instead.

00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.291
Don't serve me sticky rice.

00:16:24.375 --> 00:16:26.583
I'll serve you my own bleeding heart.

00:16:29.666 --> 00:16:30.500
What's this?

00:16:30.833 --> 00:16:32.250
No more <i>somtam</i> for me.

00:16:32.333 --> 00:16:33.166
Why not?

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:34.541
I want to eat the cook.

00:16:36.166 --> 00:16:37.000
Guys.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.250
I'll wipe your dirty mouths with my feet.

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:42.000
No, no!

00:16:42.083 --> 00:16:43.583
Your <i>somtam</i> tastes better.

00:16:46.583 --> 00:16:48.583
If I didn't have this hangover…

00:16:49.791 --> 00:16:50.791
Just ignore them.

00:16:50.875 --> 00:16:52.416
Their days are numbered.

00:16:56.833 --> 00:16:57.750
Hi, Noi.

00:16:57.833 --> 00:16:59.125
When did you get out of prison?

00:17:01.833 --> 00:17:03.541
Triple homicide.

00:17:10.583 --> 00:17:12.166
Homicide? Prison?

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.333
Just play along.

00:17:15.083 --> 00:17:15.916
Turn around,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:16.958
but don't smile.

00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:24.333
Why can't I smile?

00:17:26.416 --> 00:17:27.916
Well then…

00:17:29.166 --> 00:17:30.958
I'll smile at this girl instead.

00:17:39.458 --> 00:17:40.708
Smart move.

00:17:41.291 --> 00:17:42.541
It's my forte.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:17:59.833
Sinn.

00:18:00.083 --> 00:18:01.000
Sir.

00:18:01.083 --> 00:18:02.833
Tomorrow make me some poached eggs.

00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:03.791
Of course, sir.

00:18:04.666 --> 00:18:07.083
Do you want goose eggs or red ant eggs?

00:18:08.875 --> 00:18:09.791
Chicken eggs, idiot.

00:18:09.875 --> 00:18:10.958
Chicken then.

00:18:11.041 --> 00:18:11.916
I was joking.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.250
Relax sir, you look kinda stressed out.

00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:17.541
You're talking nonsense.

00:18:18.291 --> 00:18:20.458
Som, A-Ngun, let's eat.

00:18:20.541 --> 00:18:21.708
Yes, Mom.

00:18:23.083 --> 00:18:23.958
What's the menu?

00:18:24.041 --> 00:18:25.500
See it for yourself.

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:30.250
Wow, you're so sweet.

00:18:43.541 --> 00:18:44.541
Mr. Pla!

00:18:44.625 --> 00:18:45.458
Hello.

00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:46.916
Hi.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:49.375
Are you closed?

00:18:49.458 --> 00:18:50.791
I want to order <i>somtam.</i>

00:18:50.875 --> 00:18:53.875
It's pretty late,
there's no more papaya left.

00:18:58.125 --> 00:18:59.625
Confused, yeah?

00:18:59.708 --> 00:19:02.458
You don't remember?
He gave you a ride here last night.

00:19:02.541 --> 00:19:04.416
You were as drunk as a skunk.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.500
Why drink if you don't get drunk?

00:19:08.208 --> 00:19:09.500
Have we met before?

00:19:09.791 --> 00:19:10.625
Twice.

00:19:10.708 --> 00:19:12.833
The first time you nearly ran over me.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.541
The second time you threw up on me.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Oh, yes.

00:19:17.708 --> 00:19:18.666
I'm sorry.

00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:20.333
Thanks for the ride.

00:19:20.416 --> 00:19:23.291
It's all right, but no more
crazy surprises today, okay?

00:19:23.708 --> 00:19:25.500
Well…

00:19:25.625 --> 00:19:26.833
You made a pass at him?

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:28.833
No, bitch!

00:19:30.541 --> 00:19:33.125
We're closed, come again tomorrow morning.

00:19:33.208 --> 00:19:34.041
A meal is on me.

00:19:34.125 --> 00:19:35.083
I'm not in a hurry.

00:19:36.041 --> 00:19:37.541
I'll be around for a few days.

00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:41.041
In that case,

00:19:41.125 --> 00:19:42.916
why don't you join us?

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.250
We're setting up the table anyway. Come.

00:19:48.416 --> 00:19:49.708
We're about to eat.

00:19:49.791 --> 00:19:50.958
One more mouth to feed.

00:19:52.208 --> 00:19:53.208
Damn.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.041
I'll serve you.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.041
Hi there.

00:19:58.125 --> 00:19:58.958
Hi.

00:20:01.083 --> 00:20:02.000
Som, shall we go?

00:20:02.083 --> 00:20:02.916
Let's go.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.250
I heard you were dead-drunk last night.

00:20:05.333 --> 00:20:06.458
Can't remember a thing!

00:20:06.541 --> 00:20:07.625
I awoke with makeup on.

00:20:07.708 --> 00:20:08.791
Hair of the dog?

00:20:08.875 --> 00:20:10.708
No, no.

00:20:10.791 --> 00:20:12.958
Thanks, but maybe tomorrow.

00:20:13.041 --> 00:20:13.916
We're off now.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.416
-Later.
-Don't worry.

00:20:16.708 --> 00:20:17.541
"Don't worry?"

00:20:17.625 --> 00:20:18.458
No.

00:20:18.541 --> 00:20:19.833
You said that last night.

00:20:23.625 --> 00:20:24.500
The guy…

00:20:25.416 --> 00:20:26.375
is Som's boyfriend?

00:20:26.458 --> 00:20:28.000
No! No!

00:20:29.416 --> 00:20:30.291
Shut up.

00:20:31.333 --> 00:20:33.125
Noi's her best friend.

00:20:33.208 --> 00:20:36.291
He supplies fermented fish to us.

00:20:36.375 --> 00:20:38.666
Or what they call in English…

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:40.541
a business <i>partner.</i>

00:20:40.625 --> 00:20:42.000
Right.

00:20:42.541 --> 00:20:43.375
Whatever.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:45.375
Not her boyfriend.

00:21:05.708 --> 00:21:12.250
<i>Don't blame me,</i>
<i>I never saw your girl before</i>

00:21:13.333 --> 00:21:15.500
<i>The air was nice,</i>
<i>So I wanna drink some more</i>

00:21:15.583 --> 00:21:17.333
<i>I got drunk so I slept on the floor</i>

00:21:17.416 --> 00:21:20.916
<i>Not looking for a fight</i>
<i>And I don't want a war</i>

00:21:22.916 --> 00:21:25.791
<i>Came for a hair of the dog,</i>
<i>But almost got socked</i>

00:21:25.958 --> 00:21:28.708
<i>I took a few sips and I almost got slogged</i>

00:21:28.791 --> 00:21:31.791
<i>The girl in white gave me a smile</i>

00:21:31.875 --> 00:21:34.791
<i>Her boyfriend saw it and became hostile</i>

00:21:34.875 --> 00:21:37.666
<i>I just came to drink,</i>
<i>But she gave me a wink</i>

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:40.791
<i>I almost got floored, please, not any more</i>

00:21:40.875 --> 00:21:43.750
<i>You are lovely,</i>
<i>But your boy got all gruffy</i>

00:21:43.833 --> 00:21:47.625
<i>Please stop working your charm</i>

00:21:48.166 --> 00:21:50.291
<i>I want to go home unharmed</i>

00:21:52.708 --> 00:21:54.333
<i>Happy birthday,</i> Tong!

00:21:54.416 --> 00:21:55.250
Hey!

00:21:55.333 --> 00:21:57.666
Hi, hi.

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:58.625
Thank you.

00:21:58.708 --> 00:22:00.291
Put it down.

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:01.791
Careful.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:03.875
Come sit down.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.166
-Som.
-What?

00:22:09.708 --> 00:22:12.083
These three clowns look familiar.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.291
They were at our restaurant earlier.

00:22:16.375 --> 00:22:18.583
Look, we're going home now.

00:22:18.666 --> 00:22:21.458
What? Sit down and drink with us!

00:22:22.791 --> 00:22:24.083
What's the hurry?

00:22:25.291 --> 00:22:26.833
Are you guys already drunk?

00:22:26.916 --> 00:22:29.875
Thai people have to drink together,
that's the spirit.

00:22:29.958 --> 00:22:31.500
-Fai.
-Yes.

00:22:31.583 --> 00:22:33.625
What's that song you sang?

00:22:34.916 --> 00:22:36.541
Right, it's popular now.

00:22:36.625 --> 00:22:37.750
"Love is a Pain in the Ass."

00:22:37.833 --> 00:22:38.708
Music, please.

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:43.041
Give me a hand.

00:22:50.375 --> 00:22:52.000
I love this song.

00:22:52.916 --> 00:22:55.166
Written by The Cicada of Chee River.

00:22:56.416 --> 00:22:57.916
Really.

00:22:58.458 --> 00:23:04.625
<i>Damn right I've got no style</i>

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:11.791
<i>So you've left me for another guy</i>

00:23:12.041 --> 00:23:16.875
<i>How could you dump me just like that?</i>

00:23:17.791 --> 00:23:20.583
<i>Did you forget our amorous night</i>

00:23:20.666 --> 00:23:23.666
<i>In the shack under the moonlight</i>

00:24:00.708 --> 00:24:02.791
What has brought you out here, sir?

00:24:02.875 --> 00:24:04.416
Who owns this plot of land?

00:24:04.541 --> 00:24:07.750
It's part of the factory.
The owner is called…

00:24:07.833 --> 00:24:09.000
Pla?

00:24:09.083 --> 00:24:09.916
Yes, that's me.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:13.875
The land behind the temple belongs to you?

00:24:13.958 --> 00:24:14.791
Yes, Venerable.

00:24:14.875 --> 00:24:17.958
I'd like to ask your permission

00:24:18.041 --> 00:24:21.333
to start a vegetable farm on that plot.

00:24:21.416 --> 00:24:25.166
Great idea. If I can contribute
to the community,

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:26.583
I'd be delighted.

00:24:26.666 --> 00:24:29.250
Thank you.

00:24:29.333 --> 00:24:31.500
If you need anything else,

00:24:31.583 --> 00:24:32.416
just let me know.

00:24:33.375 --> 00:24:35.416
Handsome boy, handsome heart.

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.708
Please excuse me then.

00:24:38.791 --> 00:24:40.416
Go on.

00:24:42.541 --> 00:24:45.666
Sir, food offerings from my mother.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.916
Just put it down.

00:24:48.208 --> 00:24:49.041
You.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.958
What are you doing here?

00:24:52.041 --> 00:24:56.375
To play blackjack. Nope!
I'm here to see the abbot, of course.

00:24:56.708 --> 00:24:58.958
I should throw up on you again.

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:03.875
Not again.
I still can't get rid off the stink.

00:25:04.666 --> 00:25:07.000
You two know each other?

00:25:07.416 --> 00:25:09.041
We met a few days ago.

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:11.416
She was drunk and threw up on me.

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.541
What? Som!

00:25:14.166 --> 00:25:15.541
You're a girl.

00:25:16.041 --> 00:25:18.375
Behave yourself or no man will want you.

00:25:19.291 --> 00:25:20.833
Take it easy with the booze, okay?

00:25:22.208 --> 00:25:24.750
You didn't listen to me at all.

00:25:25.458 --> 00:25:27.166
These two…

00:25:29.666 --> 00:25:32.208
I thought you only hang out in bars.

00:25:32.375 --> 00:25:34.125
Watch your mouth.

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:35.250
Just kidding.

00:25:36.208 --> 00:25:37.333
Where to now?

00:25:37.416 --> 00:25:38.458
Your restaurant.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.041
To eat your <i>somtam.</i>

00:25:40.125 --> 00:25:41.791
And I'll eat you as a side dish.

00:25:41.875 --> 00:25:44.083
See you then.

00:25:44.291 --> 00:25:45.416
Can I ride with you?

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:46.791
You have your car.

00:25:46.875 --> 00:25:48.416
Can't I go with you?

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:50.583
No.

00:26:20.875 --> 00:26:22.583
Auntie, is this your recipe?

00:26:22.666 --> 00:26:24.208
"Auntie" sounds like an old hag.

00:26:24.291 --> 00:26:25.833
-Call me "Mother".
-Sure.

00:26:25.916 --> 00:26:27.125
-Mother, okay?
-Sure.

00:26:27.208 --> 00:26:28.208
-Try it.
-Mother.

00:26:28.291 --> 00:26:29.541
Good.

00:26:29.625 --> 00:26:30.458
This is my recipe.

00:26:30.541 --> 00:26:32.875
Sucking up to the rich boy.

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:35.375
Bullshit.

00:26:35.583 --> 00:26:37.125
I don't like this.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.083
This is so good
you should open a branch in Bangkok.

00:26:41.541 --> 00:26:46.041
I was thinking about it,
but I don't know anyone there.

00:26:47.458 --> 00:26:50.416
I have lots of friends in Bangkok.

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:53.375
If you want any help, just say it.

00:26:53.625 --> 00:26:55.333
-Really?
-Yes.

00:26:55.958 --> 00:26:57.208
Awesome.

00:26:57.958 --> 00:26:59.708
Come back any time.

00:26:59.791 --> 00:27:01.791
Bring your wife and kid too.

00:27:01.875 --> 00:27:02.708
Well…

00:27:03.166 --> 00:27:04.125
I'm single.

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:07.333
Really?

00:27:07.416 --> 00:27:08.250
Yes.

00:27:08.666 --> 00:27:10.291
Som is also single.

00:27:12.166 --> 00:27:13.541
Just perfect.

00:27:16.541 --> 00:27:17.791
Pla, what's your real name?

00:27:17.875 --> 00:27:19.583
-My official name?
-Yes.

00:27:19.666 --> 00:27:20.541
Apiwat.

00:27:20.625 --> 00:27:21.958
Like the country singer.

00:27:22.416 --> 00:27:25.250
That guy is so stuck-up, I don't like him.

00:27:25.333 --> 00:27:26.375
You sure?

00:27:26.458 --> 00:27:29.041
I asked him for some selfies,
he gave me only one.

00:27:29.125 --> 00:27:30.291
How come?

00:27:30.375 --> 00:27:31.750
Well, don't blame him.

00:27:31.833 --> 00:27:33.708
I'm a <i>big fan</i> of his.

00:27:33.791 --> 00:27:34.625
Really?

00:27:34.708 --> 00:27:36.625
I click <i>"Like "</i> and <i>"Share"</i>
on all his posts.

00:27:36.708 --> 00:27:38.541
Who's your favorite singer then?

00:27:38.625 --> 00:27:40.791
I like Fon Thanasoontorn.

00:27:41.041 --> 00:27:43.291
-That bitch?
-What's wrong?

00:27:43.375 --> 00:27:44.875
-I hate her guts.
-Yeah?

00:27:44.958 --> 00:27:45.916
A real stuck-up bitch.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:46.833
You sure?

00:27:46.916 --> 00:27:48.708
She ran off into her van after a concert.

00:27:48.791 --> 00:27:50.916
Not even one selfie.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.208
Don't blame her, I'm also a big fan.

00:27:53.291 --> 00:27:56.791
I follow her Instagram.
She has a lot of dogs.

00:27:56.875 --> 00:27:59.458
She only pretends to love animals.

00:27:59.541 --> 00:28:00.583
Maybe she eats them.

00:28:01.166 --> 00:28:03.708
Boils them alive and eats them.

00:28:05.666 --> 00:28:06.666
Unfollow her.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.958
Som, he's making his intention
clear to your mother.

00:28:11.416 --> 00:28:13.250
It's as clear as day.

00:28:14.458 --> 00:28:18.083
I envy you.
Two pretty boys are chasing you.

00:28:19.916 --> 00:28:21.000
Me?

00:28:21.416 --> 00:28:22.958
<i>Nada.</i>

00:28:23.125 --> 00:28:24.625
Asshole Cupid.

00:28:29.666 --> 00:28:30.750
Sometimes

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:33.750
you should
check yourself out in the mirror.

00:28:33.958 --> 00:28:35.291
Bitch.

00:28:36.083 --> 00:28:37.625
That's mean.

00:28:46.916 --> 00:28:48.500
Looks good.

00:28:52.375 --> 00:28:53.208
Sinn.

00:28:53.958 --> 00:28:54.875
Sir.

00:28:55.208 --> 00:28:56.250
This egg is rotten.

00:28:56.625 --> 00:28:57.750
Didn't you check it first?

00:28:58.541 --> 00:29:00.250
The sign at the shop says,

00:29:00.333 --> 00:29:01.416
"Farm Fresh Eggs."

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:04.333
If it was "Rotten Eggs From Farm",
I wouldn't have bought it.

00:29:05.791 --> 00:29:07.291
Why didn't you crack it first?

00:29:07.375 --> 00:29:10.458
Sir, they're eggs.

00:29:11.125 --> 00:29:13.666
How could I check them first?

00:29:14.208 --> 00:29:16.291
Who'd let you crack an egg before buying?

00:29:16.708 --> 00:29:19.583
This temple is a madhouse.

00:29:52.916 --> 00:29:55.083
Who was that guy on your bike?

00:29:57.583 --> 00:29:59.125
An acquaintance.

00:30:00.291 --> 00:30:02.625
Jealous?

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:03.958
No.

00:30:04.458 --> 00:30:05.458
Just curious.

00:30:08.375 --> 00:30:10.208
Noi, come sit down.

00:30:10.916 --> 00:30:12.333
Let's eat.

00:30:13.208 --> 00:30:14.125
What's for lunch?

00:30:15.083 --> 00:30:17.083
It's a <i>somtam</i> joint,

00:30:17.166 --> 00:30:18.541
you think we'll serve spaghetti?

00:30:19.541 --> 00:30:20.708
Ouch.

00:30:25.125 --> 00:30:27.833
What's this?
My tongue's going to catch fire

00:30:27.916 --> 00:30:29.791
What's with all these chilies?

00:30:30.333 --> 00:30:31.458
Can you eat it?

00:30:31.791 --> 00:30:33.083
If you can't, then don't.

00:30:33.166 --> 00:30:34.166
Right.

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:36.625
To eat or not to eat,
that is the question.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:38.625
How much you eat is how much you love her.

00:30:55.583 --> 00:30:56.916
Should I call a fire truck?

00:30:59.916 --> 00:31:00.750
Are you okay, Noi?

00:31:13.916 --> 00:31:15.958
Take it.

00:31:16.041 --> 00:31:17.083
-Thank you, sir.
-Here.

00:31:17.166 --> 00:31:18.166
Goodbye, sir.

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:19.875
-Goodbye.
-Go on.

00:31:20.125 --> 00:31:21.208
Don't sell it!

00:31:21.291 --> 00:31:22.583
No, we'll eat it.

00:31:22.666 --> 00:31:24.291
Come back if you want more.

00:31:24.375 --> 00:31:25.208
Yes.

00:31:30.208 --> 00:31:31.250
Greetings, sir.

00:31:31.333 --> 00:31:32.208
What's the matter?

00:31:32.833 --> 00:31:34.875
I have something to discuss with you.

00:31:35.583 --> 00:31:36.416
What about?

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:37.625
About a girl.

00:31:38.458 --> 00:31:40.541
Well, I just met her.

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:43.708
But I want to know
if I should go for the kill.

00:31:44.333 --> 00:31:47.833
Why are you consulting a monk?

00:31:47.916 --> 00:31:51.125
Go talk to your parents,
someone with experience.

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:54.000
Well then…

00:31:54.875 --> 00:31:57.166
Love is a fine thing.
It's better than hatred.

00:31:58.083 --> 00:31:59.875
If you think she's the one, go for it.

00:31:59.958 --> 00:32:03.083
Destiny has brought you to meet her.

00:32:03.666 --> 00:32:04.500
That's all.

00:32:07.583 --> 00:32:08.416
Yes!

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.000
Shit!

00:32:10.916 --> 00:32:12.333
Young love.

00:32:14.458 --> 00:32:16.333
Be careful with chilies next time, okay?

00:32:16.958 --> 00:32:18.166
I will.

00:32:18.416 --> 00:32:19.791
I feel better now.

00:32:23.375 --> 00:32:24.416
Doctor.

00:32:27.125 --> 00:32:31.166
The patient has a brain hemorrhage
and needs an operation immediately.

00:32:32.583 --> 00:32:36.333
What? Food poisoning can
lead to a brain hemorrhage?

00:32:36.416 --> 00:32:38.458
Not him. Another patient in the ER.

00:32:38.958 --> 00:32:40.541
You scared him.

00:32:41.625 --> 00:32:43.208
I have to go now.

00:32:43.291 --> 00:32:45.000
Thank you, Doctor.

00:32:52.291 --> 00:32:53.750
You know what a third wheel is.

00:32:53.833 --> 00:32:54.708
Come on.

00:32:55.083 --> 00:32:56.125
Come with me.

00:33:01.666 --> 00:33:03.416
She's "the third wheel"…

00:33:05.333 --> 00:33:06.333
How are you?

00:33:06.416 --> 00:33:07.250
Feeling better?

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:09.250
Much better.

00:33:10.125 --> 00:33:11.750
Seeing your face makes me feel better.

00:33:14.208 --> 00:33:15.083
You know…

00:33:15.625 --> 00:33:17.416
Ten doctors are no match for you.

00:33:19.583 --> 00:33:20.750
You should rest now.

00:33:21.541 --> 00:33:22.625
I'll get going.

00:33:22.875 --> 00:33:23.708
Som.

00:33:30.791 --> 00:33:31.833
I have something to say.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:38.875
I want…

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:43.333
I…

00:33:47.666 --> 00:33:48.500
I have to go.

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:57.583
Who's that?

00:33:59.416 --> 00:34:00.250
What?

00:34:01.083 --> 00:34:02.416
Where did you get my number?

00:34:11.541 --> 00:34:13.375
Greetings, sir.

00:34:13.458 --> 00:34:15.041
Morning, Puang.

00:34:15.125 --> 00:34:16.500
What brings you here?

00:34:19.791 --> 00:34:21.083
Nothing much, sir.

00:34:21.166 --> 00:34:24.833
I want Sinn to buy me two lotto tickets.

00:34:25.541 --> 00:34:26.958
Lotto tickets?

00:34:27.041 --> 00:34:29.625
Okay, but where is he?

00:34:29.708 --> 00:34:32.583
Just leave the money here, I'll tell him.

00:34:32.666 --> 00:34:35.958
Please tell him for me then.

00:34:36.041 --> 00:34:37.291
Right, leave the money here.

00:34:37.375 --> 00:34:38.791
What numbers?

00:34:38.875 --> 00:34:41.666
The final two digits, 89.

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:43.208
Eighty-nine, two digits?

00:34:43.291 --> 00:34:44.916
Yes, don't forget it.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.208
You shouldn't spend too much on lotto.

00:34:47.291 --> 00:34:51.208
May I be rich this month, <i>sadhu!</i>

00:34:51.291 --> 00:34:53.125
Rich and richer!

00:34:53.333 --> 00:34:54.791
Gambling is a sin, you know.

00:34:54.875 --> 00:34:56.708
I'm going to be rich.

00:34:57.708 --> 00:34:59.000
I'm her accomplice now.

00:35:01.125 --> 00:35:02.666
Where is he?

00:35:03.416 --> 00:35:04.250
Sinn!

00:35:04.583 --> 00:35:05.833
-Sinn!
-Sir!

00:35:06.166 --> 00:35:07.041
Sinn!

00:35:07.125 --> 00:35:07.958
Coming!

00:35:09.791 --> 00:35:12.166
Puang was here.

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:13.750
-My sister?
-Yes.

00:35:13.875 --> 00:35:14.708
What did she want?

00:35:14.791 --> 00:35:17.916
She wanted you to buy
lotto tickets at the market.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.208
Here's the money.

00:35:19.291 --> 00:35:20.125
What numbers?

00:35:20.416 --> 00:35:21.708
The last two digits, 89.

00:35:21.791 --> 00:35:23.000
-Eighty-nine.
-Yes.

00:35:23.083 --> 00:35:24.333
-Two tickets?
-Yes.

00:35:24.416 --> 00:35:25.625
-Eighty-nine.
-Right.

00:35:25.708 --> 00:35:27.083
-Two digits.
-Okay.

00:35:27.333 --> 00:35:28.333
Hey.

00:35:28.416 --> 00:35:29.916
Take the bike. It's faster.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:30.833
What?

00:35:30.916 --> 00:35:32.666
Take the bike.

00:35:33.458 --> 00:35:34.291
Whatever.

00:35:41.333 --> 00:35:43.791
I told Dui to sweep the floor.

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:52.041
Plenty of <i>somtam</i> eateries in Yasothorn.

00:35:52.541 --> 00:35:54.458
What do think of this one?

00:35:55.791 --> 00:35:56.791
So-so.

00:35:57.375 --> 00:35:58.708
Yours is tastier.

00:35:58.791 --> 00:36:00.125
@LAP HONG KHA

00:36:00.208 --> 00:36:01.416
And the cook here is…

00:36:01.541 --> 00:36:02.875
not as pretty as you.

00:36:04.125 --> 00:36:05.333
Wow.

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:06.666
Cut to the chase.

00:36:07.375 --> 00:36:08.375
We've just met.

00:36:08.875 --> 00:36:10.041
Only fools rush in.

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.333
To rush or not to rush isn't the point

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:15.958
as long as you're the right one.

00:36:20.583 --> 00:36:22.291
I'm serious, no kidding.

00:36:50.875 --> 00:36:51.791
Thanks.

00:36:52.375 --> 00:36:53.500
At your service…

00:36:53.833 --> 00:36:54.916
for the rest of my life.

00:37:06.625 --> 00:37:08.208
My heart's melting.

00:37:24.708 --> 00:37:25.875
I'm damn tired.

00:37:27.083 --> 00:37:29.458
What happened?
You were gone for over an hour.

00:37:29.541 --> 00:37:31.416
Of course, you made it harder for me.

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.333
Harder how?

00:37:32.416 --> 00:37:33.458
The bike.

00:37:33.541 --> 00:37:34.958
What's wrong with it?

00:37:35.041 --> 00:37:37.166
It'd take less than
30 minutes on that bike.

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:38.416
I can't ride a bike.

00:37:38.833 --> 00:37:41.208
Then why did you take it?

00:37:41.291 --> 00:37:43.625
You said it was faster.

00:37:43.708 --> 00:37:45.708
So I walked it all the way.
It's not faster!

00:37:48.125 --> 00:37:49.583
-And the lotto?
-Here, sir.

00:37:50.375 --> 00:37:51.750
Let's check the numbers.

00:37:51.833 --> 00:37:53.541
Eighty-nine, sir.

00:37:54.333 --> 00:37:55.375
-What's this?
-Eight.

00:37:55.458 --> 00:37:56.416
-And this?
-Nine.

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:57.458
-This ticket…
-Eight.

00:37:57.541 --> 00:37:58.375
-And this…
-Nine.

00:37:58.458 --> 00:37:59.375
-So?
-Eight nine.

00:38:01.791 --> 00:38:04.791
Dumbass, she wanted eight
and nine on the same ticket.

00:38:04.875 --> 00:38:05.833
As the last two digits.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.583
These are eight and nine.

00:38:07.666 --> 00:38:10.666
But they have eight and nine at the back.

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:12.291
One has eight, the other has nine.

00:38:12.375 --> 00:38:14.333
It's impossible talking to you.

00:38:14.416 --> 00:38:16.166
I did what you told me to.

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:18.208
Now it's my fault again.

00:38:19.416 --> 00:38:20.791
I'm out of here.

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:22.833
He never says things clearly.

00:38:23.541 --> 00:38:24.666
Always picking on me.

00:38:30.958 --> 00:38:32.333
A-Ngun, what should I do?

00:38:32.875 --> 00:38:34.666
Heaven is testing me.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.458
I already have one Prince Charming,
now I have another!

00:38:39.625 --> 00:38:41.208
It's not a problem.

00:38:41.666 --> 00:38:43.041
Claim them both.

00:38:44.041 --> 00:38:45.166
Are you crazy?

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:48.875
The world has changed.

00:38:48.958 --> 00:38:51.166
There are seven days in a week.

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:53.875
You're with Noi on Monday to Wednesday.

00:38:53.958 --> 00:38:56.541
Then you're with Pla on Thursday
to Saturday.

00:38:56.625 --> 00:38:57.583
What about Sunday?

00:38:57.666 --> 00:38:58.541
Let me have them.

00:38:59.666 --> 00:39:00.583
Stop it!

00:39:01.083 --> 00:39:02.083
I'm serious.

00:39:11.791 --> 00:39:13.166
-Eggplant seeds.
-Yes.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:14.875
Papaya seeds.

00:39:15.166 --> 00:39:16.666
And chilies.

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:19.291
Scatter them and sprinkle some water.

00:39:19.375 --> 00:39:20.958
Soon they'll sprout.

00:39:21.416 --> 00:39:23.458
Noi, I've done it before.

00:39:23.541 --> 00:39:25.416
No need to teach a crocodile to swim.

00:39:26.125 --> 00:39:27.125
You're insulting me.

00:39:27.208 --> 00:39:28.666
Today's offerings, sir.

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:31.291
Som, A-Ngun, come.

00:39:31.375 --> 00:39:33.416
Put the food down.

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.166
Make the offering later.

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:36.291
-Yes.
-Right.

00:39:38.375 --> 00:39:40.000
Feeling better?

00:39:40.541 --> 00:39:41.541
Much better.

00:39:42.541 --> 00:39:44.125
Seeing your face makes me feel better.

00:39:45.666 --> 00:39:46.500
So sweet.

00:39:47.083 --> 00:39:48.291
Hot damn.

00:39:49.083 --> 00:39:50.333
Hi, Pla.

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:52.083
Come sit down.

00:39:55.958 --> 00:39:56.833
Greetings, sir.

00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.708
I'd like to invite you to perform
a blessing at the factory.

00:40:00.791 --> 00:40:02.708
Yes, sure.

00:40:03.708 --> 00:40:05.291
Som, come if you're free.

00:40:08.166 --> 00:40:09.000
I'm not free.

00:40:10.291 --> 00:40:11.250
Som.

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.208
This isn't looking good.

00:40:13.416 --> 00:40:14.500
Let's get out of here.

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:15.583
Right.

00:40:15.708 --> 00:40:16.916
Let's go.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:17.833
Let's go.

00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:19.916
Goodbye, sir.

00:40:20.833 --> 00:40:21.833
Until later.

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:26.458
She's dating multiple people.

00:40:28.708 --> 00:40:30.041
The poor monk will be starved.

00:40:35.708 --> 00:40:36.833
Sinn, we'd better leave.

00:40:37.541 --> 00:40:38.625
Or there'll be casualties.

00:40:41.625 --> 00:40:42.750
Noi with a right jab!

00:40:42.833 --> 00:40:44.875
Pla with a right hook
and a kick in the face!

00:40:45.125 --> 00:40:45.958
Noi elbowing Pla!

00:40:46.041 --> 00:40:46.875
He's bleeding!

00:40:50.625 --> 00:40:52.416
It's so hot.

00:40:53.291 --> 00:40:55.041
Damn it, I'm tired.

00:40:55.833 --> 00:40:56.666
Sir.

00:40:57.791 --> 00:40:59.333
It's better to do it in the morning

00:40:59.416 --> 00:41:00.708
or in the evening

00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:02.208
when it's not this hot.

00:41:02.791 --> 00:41:04.500
The scorching sun

00:41:04.666 --> 00:41:05.958
could burn a hole in my head.

00:41:06.375 --> 00:41:07.958
I suppose you're not very smart.

00:41:08.958 --> 00:41:11.333
"Stupid" is actually
the right word for you.

00:41:11.416 --> 00:41:12.875
I'm just too afraid to say it.

00:41:12.958 --> 00:41:14.333
It'd be a sin.

00:41:15.041 --> 00:41:17.041
So you're not smart, sir.

00:41:17.125 --> 00:41:18.375
How about this?

00:41:18.458 --> 00:41:20.458
You're on your own now.

00:41:21.291 --> 00:41:23.041
We'll come back when it cools down.

00:41:23.125 --> 00:41:25.875
Monk Ek, Monk Rong, Monk Lor,
let's take a break.

00:41:26.666 --> 00:41:28.375
Enjoy yourself, sir.

00:41:28.458 --> 00:41:29.291
Come, Dui.

00:41:33.416 --> 00:41:34.541
A bunch of lazy asses.

00:41:36.375 --> 00:41:37.750
Just trying to avoid work.

00:41:39.708 --> 00:41:41.958
Good-for-nothings.

00:41:49.416 --> 00:41:50.708
All of them.

00:41:53.916 --> 00:41:54.750
Just go.

00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:56.500
Get away from me.

00:42:00.291 --> 00:42:03.083
Loafers.

00:42:26.958 --> 00:42:28.083
You're flushed.

00:42:28.458 --> 00:42:30.291
Of course, I'm a lightweight.

00:42:31.916 --> 00:42:33.000
My face could explode…

00:42:33.083 --> 00:42:34.000
But my heart…

00:42:34.083 --> 00:42:35.375
will go on.

00:42:36.041 --> 00:42:38.041
Make a move, son.

00:42:38.125 --> 00:42:39.458
Or you'll lose Som.

00:42:39.875 --> 00:42:40.875
What should I do?

00:42:41.125 --> 00:42:42.458
Take her out. Get her drunk.

00:42:42.541 --> 00:42:43.708
And punch her in the stomach.

00:42:43.791 --> 00:42:45.500
-Punch her stomach?
-Yeah.

00:42:45.833 --> 00:42:47.125
Just do it.

00:42:47.291 --> 00:42:48.250
I'll be your lookout.

00:42:48.333 --> 00:42:49.750
That's not nice.

00:42:49.833 --> 00:42:50.666
Why not?

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:52.166
I'll be thrown in jail.

00:42:52.875 --> 00:42:54.291
Come on, she's sleeping in there.

00:42:54.375 --> 00:42:56.083
I don't want to go to jail.

00:42:56.958 --> 00:42:58.208
One more?

00:42:58.666 --> 00:42:59.500
Trust me.

00:43:00.708 --> 00:43:01.541
Punch her stomach?

00:43:01.625 --> 00:43:02.458
Yeah.

00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:05.375
Trust me.

00:43:08.041 --> 00:43:09.708
Where's my pork belly?

00:43:09.791 --> 00:43:11.083
Right here.

00:43:11.166 --> 00:43:12.208
Enjoy cooking it.

00:43:12.291 --> 00:43:13.750
A hundred baht?

00:43:13.833 --> 00:43:14.666
Yes.

00:43:15.416 --> 00:43:16.875
Same price, for you.

00:43:17.125 --> 00:43:17.958
Som.

00:43:18.791 --> 00:43:19.625
Noi.

00:43:19.708 --> 00:43:20.625
Shopping?

00:43:20.708 --> 00:43:22.458
No, delivering.

00:43:22.541 --> 00:43:25.583
Som, I want to ask you something.

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:28.666
Well…

00:43:30.333 --> 00:43:31.166
Pla…

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:36.375
Is he making a move on you?

00:43:39.416 --> 00:43:40.791
No, he's not.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:42.833
Why do you ask?

00:43:44.333 --> 00:43:46.041
Well, I have something to tell you.

00:43:46.333 --> 00:43:47.166
Som.

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:48.958
-I…
-Hey!

00:43:50.041 --> 00:43:51.166
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

00:43:51.875 --> 00:43:52.916
No worries.

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:54.416
Hi, Noi.

00:43:55.666 --> 00:43:56.708
Sorry.

00:43:57.291 --> 00:43:58.208
What were you saying?

00:44:02.083 --> 00:44:02.916
Forget it.

00:44:04.666 --> 00:44:05.500
You going somewhere?

00:44:06.666 --> 00:44:07.500
We…

00:44:07.916 --> 00:44:10.166
are going to discuss some business.
Want to come along?

00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:11.083
Go ahead.

00:44:12.416 --> 00:44:13.250
Let's go.

00:44:13.791 --> 00:44:14.625
See you.

00:44:17.666 --> 00:44:18.500
Noi.

00:44:21.958 --> 00:44:22.791
I…

00:44:24.291 --> 00:44:25.916
want to tell you

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:28.583
that…

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:32.500
please drop this at my place.

00:44:33.916 --> 00:44:34.750
Here.

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:36.333
Bye.

00:44:36.958 --> 00:44:37.791
Let's go.

00:45:13.291 --> 00:45:15.000
<i>This is a good day</i>

00:45:15.083 --> 00:45:16.583
<i>The millionaire is sad</i>

00:45:16.666 --> 00:45:18.875
<i>The rooster is scared of rice</i>

00:45:18.958 --> 00:45:20.583
<i>The pregnant girl is shocked by an ant</i>

00:45:20.666 --> 00:45:22.458
<i>The steamed rice is startled by a monk</i>

00:45:22.541 --> 00:45:24.791
<i>The lotus flower is afraid of Buddha</i>

00:45:24.875 --> 00:45:31.000
<i>The dog is afraid of a monkey</i>

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:37.875
<i>May you join your lover in heaven</i>

00:45:37.958 --> 00:45:41.541
<i>Leave me here like a loveless heathen</i>

00:45:41.625 --> 00:45:44.541
<i>May you and him find each other in heaven</i>

00:45:44.625 --> 00:45:45.541
Sometimes,

00:45:46.125 --> 00:45:48.583
set your mind free from the thing
that hasn't yet happened.

00:45:51.416 --> 00:45:58.416
<i>Give me a blessing</i>

00:46:01.958 --> 00:46:05.375
<i>I have neither diamond nor gold</i>

00:46:05.458 --> 00:46:08.916
<i>I don't go around on an elephant</i>

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.666
<i>I don't eat pizza and I don't wear a tie</i>

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:16.833
<i>I'm no good</i>

00:46:16.916 --> 00:46:20.041
<i>My hands were made to hold cigarettes</i>

00:46:20.458 --> 00:46:25.791
<i>But his hands were made to hold you</i>

00:46:26.208 --> 00:46:29.041
<i>I'm no match for him</i>

00:46:29.125 --> 00:46:33.208
<i>I'm no good</i>

00:46:33.291 --> 00:46:36.583
<i>My whole life</i>

00:46:36.708 --> 00:46:40.958
<i>For my whole life…</i>

00:46:48.833 --> 00:46:50.208
Say it.

00:46:50.791 --> 00:46:51.666
Let it out,

00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:52.666
Noi.

00:46:58.208 --> 00:47:00.333
Poor and miserable people like me

00:47:00.416 --> 00:47:02.750
will never find true love.

00:47:04.625 --> 00:47:05.458
I know.

00:47:07.125 --> 00:47:08.000
He's rich.

00:47:08.625 --> 00:47:09.458
I'm poor.

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:13.000
You know what it's like to be poor?

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:15.875
That's why I became a monk.

00:47:19.375 --> 00:47:20.208
I know

00:47:20.666 --> 00:47:21.916
that I'm handsome,

00:47:22.625 --> 00:47:24.000
but poverty and suffering

00:47:24.083 --> 00:47:25.166
have clouded my appearance.

00:47:29.875 --> 00:47:31.583
You know what it's like to be handsome?

00:47:32.291 --> 00:47:33.125
Yes.

00:47:34.083 --> 00:47:35.083
When I was 15,

00:47:35.583 --> 00:47:37.541
I was working at
a construction site in Bangkok,

00:47:38.583 --> 00:47:40.333
when a forklift rammed into
my face, "Bam!"

00:47:41.875 --> 00:47:44.083
My face flattened
and has been like this ever since.

00:47:44.583 --> 00:47:46.458
My dream of becoming a model was crushed.

00:47:46.541 --> 00:47:47.500
So I became a monk.

00:47:52.625 --> 00:47:53.916
Who's comforting who now?

00:47:55.125 --> 00:47:57.458
Listen, Noi.

00:47:58.166 --> 00:47:59.458
When it comes to love,

00:47:59.541 --> 00:48:01.666
being rich or poor
has nothing to do with it.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.875
It's all in here.

00:48:08.958 --> 00:48:09.791
Nipples?

00:48:12.375 --> 00:48:13.875
Dumbass.

00:48:14.375 --> 00:48:17.125
He's wasting my time.

00:48:17.208 --> 00:48:22.041
<i>My hands were made to hold cigarettes</i>

00:48:22.125 --> 00:48:23.916
<i>I'm no good</i>

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.458
<i>My hands were made to hold cigarettes</i>

00:48:27.541 --> 00:48:33.208
<i>But his hands were made to hold you</i>

00:48:33.291 --> 00:48:36.125
<i>I'm no match for him</i>

00:48:36.208 --> 00:48:40.250
<i>I'm no good</i>

00:48:40.333 --> 00:48:43.041
<i>My whole life</i>

00:48:43.708 --> 00:48:48.458
<i>For my whole life…</i>

00:49:19.375 --> 00:49:20.708
Why did you bring me here?

00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:23.291
To look around.

00:49:23.375 --> 00:49:25.125
So everything will be smooth on the day.

00:49:25.208 --> 00:49:27.458
Why didn't you hire a planner?

00:49:27.541 --> 00:49:28.791
It'd be more convenient.

00:49:28.916 --> 00:49:32.500
Well, a local knows better.

00:49:36.416 --> 00:49:40.166
I talked to your mother about expanding
your eatery to Bangkok.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.333
Would you like that?

00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:45.083
How can I do that?

00:49:45.375 --> 00:49:48.166
I don't know anyone
and I have no family there.

00:49:48.291 --> 00:49:50.666
You can count me as your family.

00:49:51.291 --> 00:49:54.208
Or I can be something even closer
if you want.

00:50:27.166 --> 00:50:29.500
Sir, I need your advice.

00:50:33.250 --> 00:50:35.083
What's your problem?

00:50:35.333 --> 00:50:36.166
Men, sir.

00:50:38.291 --> 00:50:40.333
One is innocent and sincere.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.875
The other is warm and attentive.

00:50:44.458 --> 00:50:45.625
Which one should I choose?

00:50:46.541 --> 00:50:49.750
I only have answers to dharma questions.

00:50:49.875 --> 00:50:52.458
Better ask the dating gurus,
DJ Chod and DJ Oy.

00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:56.666
Their show's on Friday, 10 p.m.

00:50:56.791 --> 00:50:57.708
On 100.6 MHz.

00:50:57.791 --> 00:50:58.708
It's 106.5 MHz.

00:50:58.791 --> 00:51:00.916
Yes, that's it.

00:51:01.583 --> 00:51:02.500
You listen too?

00:51:02.583 --> 00:51:03.666
Occasionally.

00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:05.166
When I can't sleep.

00:51:05.875 --> 00:51:07.791
Make up your mind.

00:51:09.083 --> 00:51:11.333
Which one of them makes you happy?

00:51:11.708 --> 00:51:12.750
Choose him.

00:51:13.333 --> 00:51:14.625
Weigh your choices.

00:51:26.708 --> 00:51:29.000
Put your weight on it.

00:51:30.125 --> 00:51:31.375
Or it'll take you forever.

00:51:32.041 --> 00:51:34.125
I'll show you.

00:51:34.333 --> 00:51:35.166
Move.

00:51:35.791 --> 00:51:37.458
Press the saw against the plank.

00:51:37.541 --> 00:51:38.916
It'll be quicker.

00:51:39.625 --> 00:51:40.458
Go nail that thing.

00:51:40.708 --> 00:51:42.208
Watch, I'll show you.

00:51:42.541 --> 00:51:43.375
Wait, sir.

00:51:44.041 --> 00:51:45.708
I'm confused.

00:51:45.791 --> 00:51:48.416
You want me to watch or to nail that.

00:51:49.708 --> 00:51:51.000
I'm just saying…

00:51:51.458 --> 00:51:53.166
One thing at a time.

00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:55.041
Watch and then put the nail there.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.250
Stop. Kids, be careful.

00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:16.291
The rope is going to snap.

00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:18.583
-Sinn.
-Yes.

00:52:19.041 --> 00:52:21.125
Go buy a rope and some planks.

00:52:21.791 --> 00:52:23.583
Me again.

00:52:24.333 --> 00:52:26.208
Am I in a sweatshop or what?

00:52:26.708 --> 00:52:27.875
I think it's Pla.

00:52:28.333 --> 00:52:29.458
I think it's Noi.

00:52:29.541 --> 00:52:30.750
It's Pla. Right?

00:52:30.833 --> 00:52:32.416
Noi, for sure.

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:33.625
Pla, of course.

00:52:33.708 --> 00:52:34.791
Noi, you think?

00:52:34.875 --> 00:52:36.125
Stop.

00:52:37.208 --> 00:52:38.541
Do I look like a love guru?

00:52:41.958 --> 00:52:43.041
Pla came the other day.

00:52:44.291 --> 00:52:45.458
Then Noi.

00:52:45.541 --> 00:52:46.708
Then Som.

00:52:46.791 --> 00:52:48.166
Now it's you two.

00:52:49.833 --> 00:52:53.083
It's old-fashioned for parents to
tell their kids who to love.

00:52:54.833 --> 00:52:56.916
I already told Som,

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.750
the one she loves

00:52:58.833 --> 00:53:00.166
is the one who makes her happy.

00:53:00.583 --> 00:53:01.416
Choose him.

00:53:01.625 --> 00:53:02.666
She has to decide herself.

00:53:03.833 --> 00:53:05.791
See, it's Pla.

00:53:05.875 --> 00:53:06.916
Noi.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:07.833
Pla.

00:53:07.916 --> 00:53:09.666
-Noi.
-Pla.

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:10.583
Noi.

00:53:10.666 --> 00:53:11.958
Go!

00:53:12.291 --> 00:53:13.458
Take it somewhere else.

00:53:13.541 --> 00:53:14.375
Go.

00:53:14.625 --> 00:53:16.041
That's a nice amulet.

00:53:16.708 --> 00:53:17.958
-What is it?
-A stuffed thing.

00:53:18.041 --> 00:53:19.708
-What?
-Stuffed turd.

00:53:19.791 --> 00:53:21.291
Want one?

00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:23.625
Thanks but no thanks.

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:25.291
Take your husband with you.

00:53:25.375 --> 00:53:26.916
The monk said Pla.

00:53:27.291 --> 00:53:28.166
He meant Noi.

00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:30.125
-Pla!
-Noi!

00:53:30.208 --> 00:53:31.041
Pla!

00:53:31.666 --> 00:53:33.250
I said Noi!

00:53:33.333 --> 00:53:36.125
He said Pla!

00:53:36.791 --> 00:53:38.208
Stuffed turd, damn it.

00:54:08.875 --> 00:54:11.500
No need to invite the monks next time.

00:54:11.833 --> 00:54:13.166
A waste of time.

00:54:13.541 --> 00:54:14.791
A waste of effort.

00:54:15.291 --> 00:54:17.083
And a waste of money.

00:54:17.166 --> 00:54:18.291
It's a hassle

00:54:18.791 --> 00:54:20.208
having monks around.

00:54:21.708 --> 00:54:22.541
Well…

00:54:23.583 --> 00:54:25.000
May you be blessed.

00:54:25.083 --> 00:54:26.666
May you live in peace.

00:54:28.083 --> 00:54:30.041
Let's go.

00:54:30.125 --> 00:54:33.875
May your business prosper.

00:54:34.791 --> 00:54:37.208
SORNRAM'S SOMTAM &amp; ROAST CHICKEN

00:54:47.291 --> 00:54:48.375
Hey, Noi.

00:54:48.666 --> 00:54:49.958
You said you were busy.

00:55:12.833 --> 00:55:14.750
It's nothing, please continue.

00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:16.666
Have some <i>somtam.</i>

00:55:24.625 --> 00:55:26.541
Next up, "Love, Passion, Jealousy".

00:55:26.625 --> 00:55:28.416
Enjoy the show.

00:55:36.166 --> 00:55:37.000
Noi.

00:55:37.458 --> 00:55:38.291
Noi!

00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:40.416
Where are you going?

00:55:43.458 --> 00:55:44.750
What do you care?

00:55:45.541 --> 00:55:46.541
What's wrong with you?

00:55:46.666 --> 00:55:47.791
I'm poor, that's what.

00:55:48.958 --> 00:55:50.750
I have nothing to make you like me.

00:55:53.458 --> 00:55:54.666
Why are you saying this?

00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:55.750
It's the truth.

00:55:56.458 --> 00:55:57.291
He's rich.

00:55:58.708 --> 00:55:59.666
It's normal.

00:56:00.166 --> 00:56:01.416
Everyone wants an easy life.

00:56:01.625 --> 00:56:02.541
Stop insulting me!

00:56:02.625 --> 00:56:04.541
I'm not, I'm being honest.

00:56:05.583 --> 00:56:07.250
How many days have you known him?

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.208
How many days?

00:56:11.833 --> 00:56:13.333
Money can buy everything.

00:56:13.625 --> 00:56:14.583
Even love.

00:56:14.666 --> 00:56:15.666
Even you.

00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:16.708
Even your heart.

00:56:17.875 --> 00:56:18.833
Stop accusing me!

00:56:19.208 --> 00:56:20.291
Stop talking nonsense!

00:56:20.583 --> 00:56:21.666
Stop making assumptions.

00:56:22.083 --> 00:56:22.916
Stop insulting me!

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.791
I'm speaking the truth!

00:56:39.583 --> 00:56:41.208
Bullshit factory!

00:56:47.083 --> 00:56:49.958
One meter…

00:56:50.041 --> 00:56:51.125
Three should be enough.

00:56:51.666 --> 00:56:52.583
Sinn.

00:56:53.041 --> 00:56:54.125
Hurry up and finish it.

00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:55.583
So the kids can play.

00:56:55.916 --> 00:56:56.875
The kids will have fun,

00:56:56.958 --> 00:56:58.416
but I'm sweating like a pig.

00:56:59.666 --> 00:57:01.208
Why do you always complain?

00:57:02.916 --> 00:57:04.500
Dui, put the ropes down.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.250
What are you looking at?

00:57:06.333 --> 00:57:08.083
You go up and test it.

00:57:08.166 --> 00:57:09.666
No, I'm scared of heights.

00:57:11.125 --> 00:57:12.333
Sinn, you do it.

00:57:12.875 --> 00:57:14.500
I don't have time to die, sir.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.333
What if the rope snaps
and I fall to my death?

00:57:17.625 --> 00:57:19.458
My life is already hopeless.

00:57:19.541 --> 00:57:22.041
Don't make me die so stupidly.

00:57:22.125 --> 00:57:23.625
I think you should go up.

00:57:23.708 --> 00:57:26.416
If the rope snaps and you fall,

00:57:26.666 --> 00:57:29.083
it'll be such a dignified death.

00:57:29.166 --> 00:57:31.083
Die like a courageous monk.

00:57:31.291 --> 00:57:32.791
They'll build you a monument.

00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:34.458
You go.

00:57:36.583 --> 00:57:38.666
Three… and nine…

00:57:39.208 --> 00:57:40.625
Three times nine is what?

00:57:41.083 --> 00:57:41.916
Twelve, sir.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.166
Moron!

00:57:46.708 --> 00:57:48.041
Three times nine is 12…

00:57:48.750 --> 00:57:50.208
Five… eight…

00:57:50.291 --> 00:57:51.416
What about five minus eight?

00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:52.333
Twenty.

00:57:55.333 --> 00:57:57.083
This clown's cracking me up.

00:57:57.166 --> 00:57:59.416
Go with Dui to paint the wall.

00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:00.458
Yes.

00:58:01.333 --> 00:58:02.500
Dui.

00:58:02.958 --> 00:58:05.958
What do we get if we mix yellow with red?

00:58:06.041 --> 00:58:07.000
It will look like shit.

00:58:09.791 --> 00:58:10.875
Shit!

00:58:15.083 --> 00:58:17.791
You're so blessed, sir…

00:58:18.583 --> 00:58:20.166
having us as your minions.

00:58:27.666 --> 00:58:29.125
Som, what's wrong?

00:58:30.375 --> 00:58:31.375
Nothing.

00:58:34.333 --> 00:58:35.291
When are you free?

00:58:36.916 --> 00:58:39.083
Let's go to Bangkok and check out a place

00:58:39.208 --> 00:58:40.041
for my <i>somtam</i> joint.

00:58:40.125 --> 00:58:41.208
Seriously?

00:58:41.583 --> 00:58:42.416
I'm free.

00:58:42.875 --> 00:58:43.750
Always free.

00:58:44.208 --> 00:58:46.416
I'm free for the rest of my life.
We can go now.

00:58:46.958 --> 00:58:48.416
Tomorrow is okay.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.375
Where did you get these chairs?

00:58:55.458 --> 00:58:57.416
Put them away and return them.

00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:58.875
You slackers.

00:58:58.958 --> 00:59:00.916
How many times do I have to tell you?

00:59:01.458 --> 00:59:02.541
All the guests have left.

00:59:02.625 --> 00:59:04.125
Why are you still here, hey?

00:59:04.208 --> 00:59:05.875
Do you plan to stay here all night?

00:59:05.958 --> 00:59:06.791
Get up!

00:59:11.541 --> 00:59:12.541
Is it strong enough?

00:59:13.875 --> 00:59:14.791
Let's test it.

00:59:21.625 --> 00:59:23.041
Monk Chai can fly!

00:59:23.583 --> 00:59:24.875
The flying monk!

00:59:30.208 --> 00:59:31.500
Hi, Mother. Hi, Father.

00:59:31.583 --> 00:59:32.458
Hi, Pla.

00:59:32.541 --> 00:59:33.666
Let me get that.

00:59:35.041 --> 00:59:36.500
Please take care of my girls.

00:59:36.583 --> 00:59:37.833
I will, don't worry.

00:59:37.916 --> 00:59:39.250
I'll take good care of them.

00:59:40.791 --> 00:59:41.708
Take mine too.

00:59:43.708 --> 00:59:44.833
Take care.

00:59:45.125 --> 00:59:46.875
Yes, Mom. See you.

00:59:46.958 --> 00:59:47.791
Good luck.

00:59:47.875 --> 00:59:48.708
Bye.

00:59:50.916 --> 00:59:51.750
What?

00:59:52.375 --> 00:59:53.625
Noi's delivery.

00:59:54.083 --> 00:59:57.041
But where is he?

00:59:57.333 --> 00:59:58.166
Do you know?

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:07.333
Take it.

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:11.291
I feel sorry for Noi.

01:00:13.125 --> 01:00:16.166
If something happens to my daughter,
I'll go after you.

01:00:16.666 --> 01:00:19.000
Well, are you happy?

01:00:19.583 --> 01:00:21.750
Scoring a rich son-in-law.

01:00:22.458 --> 01:00:23.291
Of course.

01:00:23.958 --> 01:00:25.125
Good luck, girls.

01:00:29.875 --> 01:00:30.833
Let's go inside.

01:01:10.958 --> 01:01:17.083
<i>Felt like I was breathing my last breath</i>

01:01:17.333 --> 01:01:24.333
<i>When you said goodbye</i>
<i>You condemned me to death</i>

01:01:24.708 --> 01:01:30.791
<i>Life was hopeless and I was speechless</i>

01:01:31.208 --> 01:01:34.333
<i>I could only stare at the sky</i>

01:01:34.416 --> 01:01:39.708
<i>Like a madman, deranged and petrified</i>

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:49.041
<i>A pill can cure a headache</i>

01:01:49.125 --> 01:01:52.708
<i>But heartache</i>

01:01:52.791 --> 01:01:57.208
<i>Tormented me more than death</i>

01:01:57.416 --> 01:02:02.958
<i>Girl, why did you do this to me?</i>

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:08.708
<i>My heart smothered</i>

01:02:08.791 --> 01:02:15.083
<i>My body cannot recover</i>

01:02:15.166 --> 01:02:22.166
<i>Will you please come back to me?</i>

01:02:22.291 --> 01:02:29.291
<i>Girl, tell me you'll come back to me</i>

01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:36.291
<i>Did you forget the fermented fish</i>
<i>In a bowl painted with chicken?</i>

01:02:36.666 --> 01:02:43.416
<i>The somtam sauce that made</i>
<i>Your heartbeat quicken</i>

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:50.500
<i>The fermented fish we once ate together</i>

01:02:50.916 --> 01:02:57.916
<i>The old bowl of sauce will be ours forever</i>

01:02:58.458 --> 01:02:59.541
NO FISHING

01:03:22.166 --> 01:03:23.416
MOTHER

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:29.583
<i>Felt like I was breathing my last breath</i>

01:03:29.791 --> 01:03:33.083
<i>When you said goodbye</i>

01:03:33.166 --> 01:03:37.166
<i>You condemned me to death</i>

01:03:37.458 --> 01:03:43.416
<i>Oh love, come back and hurt me no more</i>

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:49.458
<i>My warm arms are waiting</i>

01:03:49.625 --> 01:03:53.166
<i>To hold you like before</i>

01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:54.333
BROTHER

01:03:54.416 --> 01:04:00.083
<i>My warm arms are waiting</i>

01:04:00.791 --> 01:04:07.791
<i>To hold you like before</i>

01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:28.708
Welcome.

01:04:34.791 --> 01:04:36.375
You two wait here.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.333
Good afternoon.

01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:44.125
I phoned yesterday.

01:04:44.958 --> 01:04:45.791
Thanks.

01:04:50.583 --> 01:04:51.416
Your key.

01:04:52.416 --> 01:04:54.000
Tomorrow's my mother's birthday.

01:04:54.416 --> 01:04:55.541
Put on your best dress.

01:04:58.208 --> 01:04:59.291
I don't have one.

01:04:59.583 --> 01:05:00.541
Don't worry.

01:05:00.625 --> 01:05:02.000
Leave it to me.

01:05:02.083 --> 01:05:02.916
Just go with him.

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:07.083
Well, go get some rest.

01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:08.583
Sweet dreams.

01:05:09.250 --> 01:05:10.916
Don't forget to dream about…

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.916
About…

01:05:16.958 --> 01:05:18.833
So lame.

01:05:18.916 --> 01:05:19.750
Just say it!

01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:21.375
Pathetic.

01:05:39.125 --> 01:05:40.625
You look like a sick dog.

01:05:41.708 --> 01:05:43.000
When was your last shower?

01:05:43.083 --> 01:05:44.625
You ooze dog smell too.

01:05:46.583 --> 01:05:48.166
Love hurts, right?

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:03.416
Sinn.

01:06:04.208 --> 01:06:06.208
He didn't measure the high tide.

01:06:07.041 --> 01:06:10.000
We have to raise the bridge
a few more inches.

01:06:11.833 --> 01:06:13.583
Let's test it.

01:06:16.583 --> 01:06:17.541
Who's that?

01:06:19.208 --> 01:06:21.625
Monk Chai!

01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:25.125
He can walk on water!
I have to take a video!

01:06:26.708 --> 01:06:28.083
Record…

01:06:30.916 --> 01:06:32.166
and share.

01:06:38.708 --> 01:06:39.791
Wow.

01:06:40.666 --> 01:06:42.416
He's invisible!

01:06:43.125 --> 01:06:46.041
Monk Chai can perform miracles!

01:06:46.916 --> 01:06:48.875
A holy man in our village!

01:06:51.708 --> 01:06:53.875
Damn Sinn!

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:56.375
He's only done half the bridge.

01:06:56.708 --> 01:06:57.708
Damn it!

01:07:01.041 --> 01:07:01.875
Dui!

01:07:02.875 --> 01:07:03.708
Dui!

01:07:06.916 --> 01:07:07.958
Get up!

01:07:08.041 --> 01:07:08.875
Goddamn fish!

01:07:11.291 --> 01:07:12.625
Don't nibble there!

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.500
My poor willy.

01:07:26.791 --> 01:07:28.250
Come look at this.

01:07:28.333 --> 01:07:29.875
Monk Chai can walk on water.

01:07:32.166 --> 01:07:34.000
It's a miracle!

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.083
It's mine!

01:07:45.708 --> 01:07:46.958
Look at these people.

01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:48.833
Stop it!

01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:56.000
You're being superstitious.

01:07:59.166 --> 01:08:01.458
I don't have a super power.

01:08:01.541 --> 01:08:03.041
I can't perform miracles.

01:08:03.833 --> 01:08:05.208
Not with the snake.

01:08:05.875 --> 01:08:07.625
Not on the bridge.

01:08:08.083 --> 01:08:10.625
The flying monk rumor is utter nonsense.

01:08:11.291 --> 01:08:15.750
If you want my robe, go ahead.

01:08:15.833 --> 01:08:16.666
Share it.

01:08:22.458 --> 01:08:27.000
Damn, I'll have to go
buy a new one for him.

01:08:27.875 --> 01:08:29.125
Sir.

01:08:29.458 --> 01:08:31.541
You've been wearing the yellow robe.

01:08:31.791 --> 01:08:34.333
Don't you want to try red sometimes?

01:08:38.125 --> 01:08:41.333
Dui, which color is he?

01:08:41.833 --> 01:08:44.416
Color blind, I think.

01:08:44.958 --> 01:08:47.958
Good, he's neutral then.

01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:40.375
Som.

01:09:41.791 --> 01:09:43.208
You look beautiful.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.708
It took too much effort to look beautiful.

01:09:46.791 --> 01:09:48.000
Exhausting for me, I guess.

01:09:49.666 --> 01:09:50.833
Just for today.

01:09:56.583 --> 01:09:57.541
Who's this?

01:09:58.583 --> 01:10:00.291
Meet my dad and my mom.

01:10:00.791 --> 01:10:01.666
This is Som.

01:10:02.375 --> 01:10:03.375
Good afternoon.

01:10:03.458 --> 01:10:04.916
Wow, Som.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.583
You're as pretty as Pla described.

01:10:07.250 --> 01:10:08.625
Pla has good taste.

01:10:09.208 --> 01:10:11.000
Sit down.

01:10:13.208 --> 01:10:15.833
You're from Yasothorn, like us?

01:10:16.333 --> 01:10:17.166
Yes.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.750
Yasothorn girls are gorgeous.

01:10:20.375 --> 01:10:22.833
Pla!

01:10:22.916 --> 01:10:24.250
What are you doing here?

01:10:24.333 --> 01:10:25.791
Our gang is over there.

01:10:26.375 --> 01:10:27.916
Mom, Dad.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.541
Let me steal Pla for a minute.

01:10:32.291 --> 01:10:34.625
And you.

01:10:34.708 --> 01:10:36.541
When someone barges in like this,

01:10:36.625 --> 01:10:38.083
you're supposed to scooch over.

01:10:38.625 --> 01:10:40.625
So provincial.

01:10:40.875 --> 01:10:41.916
Please excuse us.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.375
Let's go.

01:10:44.041 --> 01:10:45.875
I'll be back in a minute.

01:10:47.125 --> 01:10:49.833
Every film has a jealous bitch, right?

01:10:49.916 --> 01:10:52.500
Yes. Our series too.

01:10:52.916 --> 01:10:54.833
After the news, don't forget to watch.

01:10:56.208 --> 01:10:57.625
What would you like to eat?

01:10:57.708 --> 01:11:00.541
Steak, salad or spaghetti?

01:11:00.625 --> 01:11:01.666
Dig in.

01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:02.666
Go on.

01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:04.708
-Do you have <i>kua mee</i> noodles?
-What?

01:11:05.583 --> 01:11:07.666
They don't serve that in Bangkok.

01:11:08.375 --> 01:11:10.916
I heard you make delicious <i>somtam.</i>

01:11:12.583 --> 01:11:13.458
Is it true?

01:11:13.541 --> 01:11:14.375
Yes.

01:11:14.458 --> 01:11:15.791
Yasothorn <i>somtam</i> is the best.

01:11:17.583 --> 01:11:18.416
Thanks.

01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:20.916
May you be ever richer and more beautiful.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.458
Thank you!

01:11:25.041 --> 01:11:27.333
Order whatever you want.

01:11:28.083 --> 01:11:30.833
Please excuse me a minute.

01:11:30.916 --> 01:11:32.500
Where are you going?

01:11:33.583 --> 01:11:34.500
To take a leak.

01:11:34.666 --> 01:11:36.083
Okay.

01:11:36.166 --> 01:11:39.291
Don't splatter it on your dress. Go on.

01:11:39.375 --> 01:11:40.208
Chop chop.

01:11:43.083 --> 01:11:45.541
It's great.
The nature, the people, everything.

01:11:45.625 --> 01:11:46.458
Som!

01:11:47.916 --> 01:11:49.583
Let me introduce you to my friends.

01:11:49.666 --> 01:11:50.500
This is Som.

01:11:51.291 --> 01:11:53.291
Wow, a few days in Yasothorn

01:11:53.833 --> 01:11:56.000
and you've already hooked up with a chick.

01:11:56.083 --> 01:11:59.708
What hook up? She's just Pla's friend!

01:12:01.333 --> 01:12:03.791
Hi Som, have you eaten?

01:12:03.875 --> 01:12:04.916
I'm not hungry.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.208
What do you do, Som?

01:12:06.708 --> 01:12:08.500
I sell <i>somtam</i> in Yasothorn.

01:12:09.625 --> 01:12:11.708
Som is a marvelous <i>somtam</i> chef.

01:12:11.916 --> 01:12:13.625
I'm helping her open a shop here.

01:12:15.625 --> 01:12:18.083
Are you sure?

01:12:18.166 --> 01:12:19.875
<i>Somtam,</i> really?

01:12:19.958 --> 01:12:21.916
You should open Chinese, Japanese,

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.666
Korean or European restaurants.

01:12:25.541 --> 01:12:26.916
<i>Somtam</i> is bad business.

01:12:28.041 --> 01:12:31.500
Right, there are plenty of
<i>somtam</i> joints already in Bangkok.

01:12:32.041 --> 01:12:34.166
Keep your money for something more useful.

01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:36.791
Well, just wait and see first.

01:12:37.375 --> 01:12:39.083
Maybe Som is good at grinding.

01:12:39.166 --> 01:12:40.416
I mean grinding ingredients.

01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:41.333
Right, Pla?

01:12:42.416 --> 01:12:44.041
Rhythmic grinding,

01:12:44.125 --> 01:12:45.416
and working the pestle.

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:46.916
Or maybe…

01:12:47.375 --> 01:12:49.916
You like her tongue?

01:12:53.583 --> 01:12:54.416
Well.

01:12:55.041 --> 01:12:56.458
I mean, when she tastes <i>somtam.</i>

01:12:59.541 --> 01:13:02.125
I'm going to take a leak.

01:13:07.041 --> 01:13:09.166
Pla, I was kidding.

01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:12.000
You offended her!

01:13:13.375 --> 01:13:14.958
See, she stormed off.

01:13:15.250 --> 01:13:16.125
Son.

01:13:16.208 --> 01:13:17.041
Yes, Mom.

01:13:19.791 --> 01:13:22.541
Are you serious about this girl?

01:13:24.458 --> 01:13:25.708
Yes, I am.

01:13:26.666 --> 01:13:28.458
Or I wouldn't have brought her today.

01:13:34.458 --> 01:13:37.208
Monk Rong, run through my schedule.

01:13:37.291 --> 01:13:38.416
Am I busy this month?

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:41.708
There's Monk Sompong's
<i>kathin</i> ceremony on the 18th.

01:13:41.791 --> 01:13:42.708
Right.

01:13:42.791 --> 01:13:45.666
On the 20th is Marn's funeral.

01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:47.208
Marn's dead?

01:13:47.291 --> 01:13:48.125
Covid.

01:13:48.208 --> 01:13:50.000
He died of Covid?

01:13:50.083 --> 01:13:51.625
No, he survived Covid.

01:13:52.166 --> 01:13:54.083
But he died because of a coyote.

01:13:55.208 --> 01:13:56.583
A wild dog?

01:13:56.666 --> 01:13:59.083
His wife stabbed him
after she caught him with a stripper.

01:13:59.916 --> 01:14:00.916
I see.

01:14:01.958 --> 01:14:02.791
Poor man.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:03.875
Where did he die?

01:14:03.958 --> 01:14:04.791
Chiang Rai.

01:14:08.333 --> 01:14:09.166
Sinn.

01:14:09.250 --> 01:14:10.083
Sir.

01:14:10.416 --> 01:14:11.708
Get me some ginger tea.

01:14:11.958 --> 01:14:12.791
Coming right up.

01:14:12.875 --> 01:14:14.041
Put it in the wave.

01:14:14.333 --> 01:14:16.166
-You want it hot?
-Yes.

01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:17.333
Sure.

01:14:24.250 --> 01:14:26.625
This is a safe.

01:14:26.708 --> 01:14:27.958
He said "wave", the microwave.

01:14:28.041 --> 01:14:30.250
You're so daft.

01:14:30.333 --> 01:14:32.000
This is the microwave, idiot.

01:14:32.083 --> 01:14:33.208
Let me do it.

01:14:33.291 --> 01:14:34.333
Get lost.

01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:35.458
I'll do it.

01:14:35.541 --> 01:14:37.250
Genius, yeah?

01:14:37.583 --> 01:14:38.791
"Wave" means a microwave.

01:14:40.708 --> 01:14:41.916
Moron.

01:14:42.666 --> 01:14:43.500
Stupid.

01:14:44.125 --> 01:14:46.208
Warm it up for three minutes.

01:14:48.833 --> 01:14:51.708
Do you want a Nobel Prize?

01:14:54.625 --> 01:14:55.916
What's that for?

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:20.833
Som.

01:15:23.541 --> 01:15:24.375
Are you okay?

01:15:27.666 --> 01:15:28.583
I'm fine.

01:15:32.208 --> 01:15:35.125
I'm sorry for what my friends said.

01:15:35.791 --> 01:15:37.125
I never thought of you that way.

01:15:39.083 --> 01:15:40.083
It's all right.

01:15:40.625 --> 01:15:44.291
I'm just not used to this place
and to your people.

01:15:47.958 --> 01:15:48.958
I…

01:15:50.375 --> 01:15:51.541
I'm going back to the hotel.

01:15:54.375 --> 01:15:55.208
Let me drive you.

01:15:55.625 --> 01:15:57.916
No, I can go by myself.

01:16:01.291 --> 01:16:03.125
Pla!

01:16:03.208 --> 01:16:04.166
Pla!

01:16:04.666 --> 01:16:07.291
Time for the birthday cake.

01:16:08.583 --> 01:16:09.416
Well…

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:10.833
Don't you dare.

01:16:11.291 --> 01:16:13.333
I know what you're thinking.

01:16:13.666 --> 01:16:15.666
I know everything, I just didn't say it.

01:16:17.625 --> 01:16:18.458
Let's go.

01:16:19.333 --> 01:16:20.375
Come on.

01:16:29.333 --> 01:16:36.333
<i>Please, don't walk out on me</i>

01:16:37.291 --> 01:16:41.000
<i>Stay a while longer</i>

01:16:41.083 --> 01:16:45.375
<i>I beg you</i>

01:16:45.458 --> 01:16:52.458
<i>This love of mine, does it mean nothing?</i>

01:16:53.750 --> 01:17:00.750
<i>Like a rotten egg tossed out</i>
<i>From a warm nest</i>

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.125
It's all right.

01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:59.125
I like it salty.

01:18:02.416 --> 01:18:04.041
You like <i>khao jee?</i>

01:18:04.750 --> 01:18:05.583
Yes.

01:18:07.416 --> 01:18:08.916
Do you like the <i>khao jee</i> maker?

01:18:09.916 --> 01:18:11.958
Just kidding.

01:18:47.958 --> 01:18:49.083
Som.

01:18:51.041 --> 01:18:51.875
Som.

01:18:54.041 --> 01:18:55.458
What's wrong?

01:18:58.708 --> 01:18:59.750
I don't know.

01:19:00.291 --> 01:19:02.125
I just feel like…

01:19:02.375 --> 01:19:04.083
I don't belong here.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.041
You think too much.

01:19:07.916 --> 01:19:09.250
Maybe.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.708
But I…

01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:19.000
I want to go home.

01:19:20.625 --> 01:19:21.625
Come on, Som.

01:19:22.083 --> 01:19:25.666
Stop tormenting yourself.

01:19:28.083 --> 01:19:30.625
I almost forgot!

01:19:30.708 --> 01:19:32.208
I'll be right back.

01:19:35.916 --> 01:19:36.791
What is it?

01:19:38.291 --> 01:19:41.375
Noi asked me to give it to you.

01:19:41.458 --> 01:19:42.958
I have no idea what it is.

01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:44.750
Just check it out.

01:19:53.875 --> 01:19:54.750
<i>Som.</i>

01:19:57.208 --> 01:19:59.250
<i>My heart is filled with joy</i>

01:20:00.250 --> 01:20:03.750
<i>every time I write down</i>
<i>my feelings towards you.</i>

01:20:12.708 --> 01:20:15.541
<i>Sometimes I just want to slap my own mouth</i>

01:20:18.333 --> 01:20:20.458
<i>for not allowing my heart to speak,</i>

01:20:21.250 --> 01:20:22.833
<i>so you can hear what's in my mind.</i>

01:20:24.333 --> 01:20:26.083
<i>I've always known</i>

01:20:27.291 --> 01:20:28.291
<i>that I…</i>

01:20:28.833 --> 01:20:30.333
<i>should say it out loud.</i>

01:20:31.375 --> 01:20:32.791
I love you,

01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:36.583
Som.

01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:38.666
I love you.

01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:42.416
<i>But you can't say I've never tried.</i>

01:20:42.583 --> 01:20:43.666
I love you.

01:20:44.458 --> 01:20:46.166
-Noi.
-Yeah?

01:20:46.291 --> 01:20:47.583
Hand me a plate.

01:20:55.666 --> 01:20:56.791
<i>In fact,</i>

01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:59.375
<i>I said it every time we met,</i>

01:21:01.333 --> 01:21:03.583
<i>and I hope</i>

01:21:04.666 --> 01:21:07.166
<i>that one day your heart will hear it.</i>

01:21:12.625 --> 01:21:14.375
<i>But if I say it out loud,</i>

01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:16.250
<i>will you say it back?</i>

01:21:16.333 --> 01:21:17.208
I love you.

01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:22.833
I love you so much.

01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:26.708
<i>Well, your answer isn't important,</i>

01:21:27.083 --> 01:21:30.166
<i>because I love you anyway.</i>

01:21:30.541 --> 01:21:32.041
I love you, Som.

01:21:32.791 --> 01:21:35.083
<i>"The wind, please whisper</i>
<i>into Som's ear that I love her."</i>

01:21:35.166 --> 01:21:37.916
<i>If I could turn back time,</i>
<i>I would never hold it back.</i>

01:21:39.333 --> 01:21:42.708
<i>But now it's impossible.</i>

01:21:43.541 --> 01:21:45.666
<i>It's just too late.</i>

01:21:46.333 --> 01:21:48.625
<i>I wish you all the happiness</i>

01:21:49.083 --> 01:21:51.375
<i>now that you're with the one you love.</i>

01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:56.583
I love you, Som!

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.166
Not again.

01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:03.083
Noi!

01:22:04.333 --> 01:22:06.125
You know it's useless!

01:22:06.625 --> 01:22:08.166
Stop howling like a madman.

01:22:08.833 --> 01:22:10.625
She can't hear you.

01:22:11.333 --> 01:22:13.083
You should've told her while you could.

01:22:13.625 --> 01:22:16.416
Wish you knew me when I was young.

01:22:16.708 --> 01:22:18.500
If only you were a knockout like me,

01:22:18.666 --> 01:22:20.125
she wouldn't ditch you like that.

01:22:38.875 --> 01:22:40.666
<i>Good luck, Som,</i>

01:22:41.291 --> 01:22:42.125
<i>and goodbye.</i>

01:22:42.708 --> 01:22:43.666
<i>Speak of the devil.</i>

01:23:15.250 --> 01:23:16.833
Do you want to go home?

01:23:36.083 --> 01:23:40.083
<i>So now I understand</i>

01:23:40.291 --> 01:23:44.208
<i>I'm a dog abandoned and stranded</i>

01:23:44.291 --> 01:23:48.083
<i>After everything I've done</i>

01:23:48.166 --> 01:23:51.958
<i>You threw me out like scum</i>

01:23:52.333 --> 01:23:56.166
<i>I told you how much I love you</i>

01:23:56.250 --> 01:24:00.916
<i>But my tears are worth nothing</i>

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.833
<i>The whole town is gossiping</i>

01:24:03.916 --> 01:24:07.583
<i>There's a new guy you're seeing</i>

01:24:13.166 --> 01:24:15.083
Where is Noi's house?

01:24:19.083 --> 01:24:20.291
I'll go ask Monk Chai.

01:24:37.708 --> 01:24:38.541
Noi!

01:24:38.958 --> 01:24:40.041
Noi is becoming a monk.

01:24:40.125 --> 01:24:41.666
Som, wake up!

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.708
Look, Noi is going to become a monk.

01:24:47.125 --> 01:24:47.958
Noi!

01:24:49.416 --> 01:24:50.375
You can't do this!

01:24:50.875 --> 01:24:52.125
Why not?

01:24:52.250 --> 01:24:53.250
Who the hell are you?

01:24:54.541 --> 01:24:55.583
My mother didn't stop me!

01:24:56.833 --> 01:24:57.666
Bitch.

01:24:58.958 --> 01:24:59.833
Noi's not here.

01:24:59.916 --> 01:25:02.000
He's going to see his mother
in Nakhon Phanom.

01:25:02.833 --> 01:25:04.041
He'll be away for two weeks.

01:25:04.833 --> 01:25:05.958
He might have already left.

01:25:07.625 --> 01:25:08.458
Som.

01:25:08.875 --> 01:25:09.916
I'm going to Noi's.

01:25:14.416 --> 01:25:15.250
-Sinn.
-Yes.

01:25:15.333 --> 01:25:16.791
-You do it.
-All right.

01:25:22.125 --> 01:25:23.375
Done, sir.

01:25:23.791 --> 01:25:25.083
Trendy monk.

01:25:40.833 --> 01:25:42.875
I did it again.

01:25:54.416 --> 01:25:56.083
Are you okay with it?

01:25:56.166 --> 01:25:57.750
Cat got his tongue.

01:25:58.750 --> 01:26:00.083
What do you think?

01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:16.333
Noi!

01:26:17.708 --> 01:26:18.833
Don't do it!

01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:20.083
Noi.

01:26:21.166 --> 01:26:22.416
I'm back.

01:26:23.875 --> 01:26:24.916
Don't kill yourself.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.166
Get down.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.750
I was making a swing.

01:26:46.291 --> 01:26:47.541
What's wrong with that?

01:26:57.041 --> 01:26:58.041
Noi.

01:26:58.750 --> 01:27:00.583
Do you have something to tell me?

01:27:02.041 --> 01:27:03.416
Something I never get to hear.

01:27:05.833 --> 01:27:06.791
Say it now.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.750
It doesn't matter.

01:27:13.375 --> 01:27:15.083
It probably does.

01:27:16.791 --> 01:27:17.625
Try it.

01:27:22.166 --> 01:27:23.000
Say it.

01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:24.875
You want to tell me

01:27:25.583 --> 01:27:27.125
you love me, right?

01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:31.333
Fine.

01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:33.583
Never mind.

01:27:34.333 --> 01:27:35.250
If you don't say it,

01:27:36.791 --> 01:27:38.083
I will.

01:27:43.125 --> 01:27:44.541
I love you, Noi.

01:27:51.166 --> 01:27:52.000
Well then,

01:27:53.291 --> 01:27:54.375
I'm leaving now.

01:27:59.208 --> 01:28:00.041
Pla.

01:28:07.625 --> 01:28:08.875
Are you okay?

01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:11.333
I'm okay.

01:28:18.875 --> 01:28:19.708
Pla.

01:28:28.083 --> 01:28:29.041
Are you sure?

01:28:31.541 --> 01:28:32.375
Sure.

01:29:23.416 --> 01:29:26.500
<i>Love me, love me not?</i>

01:29:26.583 --> 01:29:30.000
<i>You monkey, are you trying to fool me?</i>

01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:33.625
<i>Only a few days and your love has expired</i>

01:29:33.875 --> 01:29:36.875
<i>Apple of my eye</i>
<i>You're toying with my mind</i>

01:29:37.333 --> 01:29:40.166
<i>Love me, love me not?</i>

01:29:40.291 --> 01:29:43.791
<i>My tears are hot</i>
<i>'Cause you've left me cold</i>

01:29:44.166 --> 01:29:47.166
<i>If you'd told me, I wouldn't be so bold</i>

01:29:47.458 --> 01:29:50.916
<i>I've been waiting</i>
<i>But your love's a no-show</i>

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.958
<i>It's a sin to break a man's heart</i>

01:29:54.041 --> 01:29:57.583
<i>You're smart to play me for a fool</i>

01:29:57.916 --> 01:30:01.083
<i>But deceiving me is not so cool</i>

01:30:01.208 --> 01:30:04.541
<i>Watch out</i>
<i>'Cause karma will catch up with you</i>

01:30:04.625 --> 01:30:07.583
<i>Love me, love me not?</i>

01:30:07.666 --> 01:30:11.416
<i>You smile while hanging me out to dry</i>

01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:14.875
<i>Heaven is not worth your lies</i>

01:30:14.958 --> 01:30:19.208
<i>You're so fine</i>
<i>While I'm nursing my wounded pride</i>

01:30:54.375 --> 01:30:57.333
<i>Love me, love me not?</i>

01:30:57.416 --> 01:31:00.958
<i>You monkey, are you trying to fool me?</i>

01:31:01.375 --> 01:31:04.375
<i>Only a few days and your love has expired</i>

01:31:04.750 --> 01:31:07.750
<i>Apple of my eye</i>
<i>You're toying with my mind</i>

01:31:08.333 --> 01:31:11.000
<i>Love me, love me not?</i>

01:31:11.083 --> 01:31:14.750
<i>My tears are hot</i>
<i>'Cause you've left me cold</i>

01:31:14.833 --> 01:31:18.041
<i>If you'd told me, I wouldn't be so bold</i>

01:31:18.125 --> 01:31:21.958
<i>I've been waiting</i>
<i>But your love's a no-show</i>

01:31:22.041 --> 01:31:24.791
<i>It's a sin to break a man's heart</i>

01:31:24.875 --> 01:31:28.666
<i>You're smart to play me for a fool</i>

01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:31.916
<i>But deceiving me is not so cool</i>

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.583
<i>Watch out</i>
<i>'Cause karma will catch up with you</i>

01:31:35.666 --> 01:31:38.291
<i>Love me, love me not?</i>

01:31:38.375 --> 01:31:42.166
<i>You smile while hanging me out to dry</i>

01:31:42.250 --> 01:31:45.583
<i>Heaven is not worth your lies</i>

01:31:45.666 --> 01:31:50.375
<i>You're so fine</i>
<i>While I'm nursing my wounded pride</i>

01:32:13.333 --> 01:32:14.333
I love you, Som.

01:32:25.708 --> 01:32:28.791
<i>My tears flow like a river</i>

01:32:28.875 --> 01:32:33.833
<i>When you said we were over</i>

01:32:33.916 --> 01:32:40.916
<i>My knees gave out, my legs folded</i>

01:32:43.333 --> 01:32:50.333
<i>When you left me out in the cold</i>

01:32:51.291 --> 01:32:53.083
<i>Please don't go</i>

01:32:55.708 --> 01:32:56.625
Are you okay?

01:32:57.791 --> 01:32:58.875
I'm good.

01:33:04.083 --> 01:33:05.250
What are you looking at?

01:33:05.333 --> 01:33:06.458
Never seen an angel?

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.041
Never.

01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:11.666
But I've seen a goddess once.

01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:12.833
What are you staring at?

01:33:12.916 --> 01:33:14.041
Never seen a goddess?

01:33:14.875 --> 01:33:16.250
That's why I look like shit now.

01:33:17.458 --> 01:33:18.750
Cuckoo.

01:33:26.083 --> 01:33:28.208
I'm an angel, not a goddess.

01:33:28.291 --> 01:33:29.291
My angel…

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.208
It'll be "Double Jeopardy" for me.

01:33:40.625 --> 01:33:41.666
We're punch-drunk.

01:33:42.041 --> 01:33:43.333
And in a funk.

01:33:43.416 --> 01:33:44.541
So we'll come to see a monk.

01:33:44.625 --> 01:33:46.375
The monk is not monkeying around.

01:33:46.458 --> 01:33:48.333
So we monkeys come round.

01:33:48.458 --> 01:33:50.166
To meet the monk in the monkey ground.

01:33:53.041 --> 01:33:54.916
Guess there'll be a sequel.

01:33:55.458 --> 01:33:56.833
What's the title?

01:33:58.250 --> 01:33:59.708
Monk Chai and Loony Tai Ban.

01:34:06.250 --> 01:34:07.083
Light on.

01:34:09.416 --> 01:34:10.500
I have a super power.

01:34:12.708 --> 01:34:15.833
So you'll move to Yasothorn?

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:16.833
Yes.

01:34:17.291 --> 01:34:19.041
I'm not a mama's boy like him.

01:34:19.625 --> 01:34:22.625
Maybe you already forgot all about me.

01:34:22.708 --> 01:34:23.583
Never.

01:34:24.666 --> 01:34:26.458
Morning.

01:34:26.541 --> 01:34:27.666
Good morning, Som.

01:34:27.875 --> 01:34:29.833
Congrats on your new business.

01:34:29.916 --> 01:34:31.666
Thank you. Come in.

01:34:32.208 --> 01:34:33.958
Wait for me. My ass is heavy.

01:34:34.541 --> 01:34:37.083
It keeps getting heavier every year.

01:34:37.791 --> 01:34:39.208
Thank you, Bua.

01:34:39.291 --> 01:34:41.000
Please be kind to Noi.

01:34:41.083 --> 01:34:43.958
Don't worry.
We're best drinking buddies now.

01:34:44.541 --> 01:34:46.083
Glad to hear that.

01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:47.541
So you see,

01:34:47.958 --> 01:34:49.083
it's as I told you.

01:34:49.833 --> 01:34:52.500
Our oranges are two different fruits.

01:34:52.875 --> 01:34:55.041
Sour and tangy in Nakhon Phanom.

01:34:55.166 --> 01:34:57.291
Sweet and tender in Yasothorn.

01:34:59.291 --> 01:35:01.708
Don't rub it in!

01:35:02.416 --> 01:35:06.208
In loving memory of Pornsak Songsang.

01:35:06.291 --> 01:35:10.208
"The man with the dragon tattoo
on his left arm."

01:36:09.416 --> 01:36:12.125
Want to compete with the Yellow team?

01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:17.625
-Is that a Malaysian team?
-No. I mean, our Venerable Chai.

01:36:20.625 --> 01:36:23.000
You're gonna burn in hell
for disrespecting him.
